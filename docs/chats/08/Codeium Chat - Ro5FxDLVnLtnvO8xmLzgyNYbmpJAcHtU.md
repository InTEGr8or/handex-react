I want to add GitHub login to my React web-based TUI which uses `xterm.js` to implement the terminal environment.

I will add a command like 'connect github' wich will invoke the process if the user already has a valid Cognito account, which will direct the user to GitHub, I think, to approve the connection.

I think I have to create a GitHub application and key or something. I already have an account. 

And then I want to modify my `cdk-stack.ts` to create the OAuth link to any accounts that attach their GitHub account.

How can I do that?

To add GitHub login to your React web-based TUI application that uses `xterm.js` and integrates with AWS Cognito, you will need to perform several steps across GitHub, AWS Cognito, and your AWS CDK setup (`cdk-stack.ts`). Here’s a high-level overview of what you need to do:

### 1. Create a GitHub OAuth Application

First, create an OAuth application on GitHub to obtain the Client ID and Client Secret required for the OAuth flow:

1. Go to GitHub and sign in.
2. Navigate to your account settings.
3. Find the "Developer settings" section, then select "OAuth Apps".
4. Click "New OAuth App".
5. Fill in the application details. The "Authorization callback URL" should be the callback URL provided by AWS Cognito (it will look something like `https://<your-cognito-domain>/oauth2/idpresponse`). You'll get this URL from Cognito after setting up an identity provider.
6. After creating the app, note down the Client ID and Client Secret.

### 2. Configure AWS Cognito

Next, you'll need to configure AWS Cognito to integrate with GitHub:

1. Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to Amazon Cognito.
2. Open your existing user pool (`HandTermUserPool` based on your `cdk-stack.ts`).
3. In the Federation section, choose "Identity providers".
4. Select "GitHub" and fill in the Client ID and Client Secret obtained from the GitHub OAuth application.
5. Configure attribute mapping as required by your application.
6. Save your changes.

### 3. Update Your AWS CDK Stack

To automatically configure Cognito with GitHub as an identity provider, AWS CDK doesn't directly support configuring third-party identity providers like GitHub. You will typically set these up through the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI as part of post-deployment steps. However, ensure your user pool is configured to allow federation:

- Ensure you have domain name setup for your Cognito User Pool if not already done. This is necessary for the callback URLs to work correctly.
- You might need to manually adjust the settings in the AWS Management Console for specific configurations related to federated identities.

### 4. Implementing the 'connect github' Command

In your React TUI, you'll need to create a functionality that redirects users to the GitHub authorization page. This typically involves:

1. Creating a "Sign in with GitHub" button or command that users can interact with.
2. When triggered, redirect the user to the Cognito login page with GitHub as the chosen provider. The URL will be structured similarly to this: `https://<your-cognito-domain>/login?response_type=code&client_id=<your-app-client-id>&redirect_uri=<your-callback-url>&scope=<scope>&identity_provider=GitHub`

### 5. Handling the Callback

After the user authenticates with GitHub and grants permissions, GitHub will redirect the user back to your application (to the callback URL you specified in both GitHub and Cognito settings) along with an authorization code. Your application backend (or a serverless function) must exchange this code for tokens using Cognito APIs, and then handle the user session accordingly.

### Summary

The integration process involves manual configuration steps in both GitHub and AWS Cognito, as well as implementing redirect logic in your application. While AWS CDK simplifies much of the AWS resource provisioning, integrating GitHub OAuth with Cognito primarily relies on post-deployment configuration via the AWS Console or CLI for the identity provider setup.

You said this:

```
Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to Amazon Cognito.
Open your existing user pool (HandTermUserPool based on your cdk-stack.ts).
```

But isn't that possible from the CDK? 

I would greatly prefer to avoid using the web GUI to update AWS infrastructure, since I can't easily track those changes like I can with CDK code commits to git.

**Codeium** _at 12:33 pm, Jul 14, 2024_

You're correct in seeking to manage your infrastructure as code (IaC) using AWS CDK, which allows for version control and better tracking of changes. While the AWS CDK provides extensive support for AWS Cognito, as of my last update, direct integration of third-party identity providers like GitHub into a Cognito User Pool via CDK is not as straightforward as configuring other aspects of Cognito. This is primarily due to the AWS CDK's coverage of AWS Cognito features, which may not fully encompass all settings available in the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI, especially for third-party identity providers.

However, you can still automate the setup of a Cognito User Pool to include a custom identity provider by using the `CfnUserPoolIdentityProvider` construct, which represents the `AWS::Cognito::UserPoolIdentityProvider` resource in AWS CloudFormation. This approach allows you to specify details for integrating with GitHub.

Here's an example that outlines how you might add GitHub as an identity provider to your Cognito User Pool using the CDK, keeping in mind you'll need to replace placeholders with actual values:

```typescript
import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import * as cognito from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-cognito';

export class HandTermCdkStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    // Assuming 'userPool' is your existing Cognito User Pool CDK construct
    const userPool = new cognito.UserPool(this, 'HandTermUserPool', {
      userPoolName: 'HandTermUserPool',
      // additional configuration...
    });

    // Define GitHub as an identity provider
    new cognito.CfnUserPoolIdentityProvider(this, 'GitHubIdentityProvider', {
      providerName: 'GitHub', // This is the name you assign to your provider
      providerType: 'OIDC', // For GitHub, use 'OIDC' or 'SAML' as appropriate
      userPoolId: userPool.userPoolId,
      providerDetails: {
        // These will be specific to the OAuth provider
        // For GitHub, use the OAuth 2.0 endpoint information and credentials
        authorize_scopes: 'openid,profile,email',
        client_id: '<GITHUB_CLIENT_ID>',
        client_secret: '<GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET>',
        attributes_request_method: 'GET',
        oidc_issuer: '<GITHUB_ISSUER_URL>', // This is not directly applicable to GitHub as GitHub doesn't directly support OIDC
        // You will need to adjust the above details for GitHub's OAuth flow
      },
      attributeMapping: {
        // Map GitHub user attributes to Cognito user pool attributes
        email: 'email',
        // Add other attribute mappings as needed
      },
    });

    // Additional CDK resources and configuration...
  }
}
```

This example uses generic placeholders that you would need to replace with actual values from your GitHub OAuth application setup. Note that GitHub does not directly support OpenID Connect (OIDC), so the `providerType` and some details in `providerDetails` might not directly apply as shown. GitHub integration typically uses OAuth 2.0 without a standardized OIDC issuer URL, so you might need to explore alternative approaches or custom authentication flow implementations for integrating GitHub as an identity provider in AWS Cognito.

Due to these limitations and potential mismatches in protocol support, the most straightforward path for integrating GitHub with Cognito often involves manual configuration through the AWS Console or automating the OAuth flow in your application code, rather than directly within the Cognito User Pool configuration in CDK.

Keep in mind that AWS continually updates their services and the AWS CDK, so it's worth checking the latest AWS CDK documentation or exploring community-contributed constructs for new features or workarounds that may have been introduced after my last update.

In a Vite application, you can use environment variables to store sensitive values like the GitHub client secret. Here's how you can fetch the GitHub client secret from your `.env` file using the `VITE_` notation:

1. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following line to it:

```plaintext
VITE_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_github_client_secret
```

Replace `your_github_client_secret` with the actual client secret value.

2. In your Vite application, you can access this environment variable using the `import.meta.env` object. To fetch the GitHub client secret, you can use the following code:

```typescript
const githubClientSecret = import.meta.env.VITE_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET;
```

Note that the `VITE_` prefix in the environment variable name is required for Vite to recognize it as an environment variable.

3. Make sure to add the `.env` file to your `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being committed to your public repository.

By using environment variables in this way, you can safely store sensitive values like the GitHub client secret without exposing them in your code or version control system.

Apologies for the confusion. You are correct. In a Vite application, you can access environment variables using `process.env`. Here's how you can fetch the GitHub client secret from your `.env` file using `process.env`:

1. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following line to it:

```plaintext
VITE_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_github_client_secret
```

Replace `your_github_client_secret` with the actual client secret value.

2. In your Vite application, you can access this environment variable using `process.env`. To fetch the GitHub client secret, you can use the following code:

```typescript
const githubClientSecret = process.env.VITE_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET;
```

Make sure to add the `.env` file to your `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being committed to your public repository.

By using `process.env`, you can access environment variables in a Vite application.

Thank you for pointing out the correct usage.

The error message suggests that the required parameters for the `CfnUserPoolIdentityProvider` construct are missing or incorrect. Specifically, the `clientId`, `authorizeScopes`, `oidcIssuer`, and `attributesRequestMethod` parameters are all required.

To resolve this issue, you need to ensure that you provide the correct values for these parameters. Here's an updated example that includes the required parameters:

```typescript
import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import * as cognito from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-cognito';

export class HandTermCdkStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    // Assuming 'userPool' is your existing Cognito User Pool CDK construct
    const userPool = new cognito.UserPool(this, 'HandTermUserPool', {
      userPoolName: 'HandTermUserPool',
      // additional configuration...
    });

    // Define GitHub as an identity provider
    new cognito.CfnUserPoolIdentityProvider(this, 'GitHubIdentityProvider', {
      providerName: 'GitHub', // This is the name you assign to your provider
      providerType: 'OIDC', // For GitHub, use 'OIDC' or 'SAML' as appropriate
      userPoolId: userPool.userPoolId,
      providerDetails: {
        // These will be specific to the OAuth provider
        // For GitHub, use the OAuth 2.0 endpoint information and credentials
        authorize_scopes: 'openid,profile,email',
        client_id: process.env.VITE_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID, // Use process.env to fetch the client ID from the environment variable
        client_secret: process.env.VITE_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET, // Use process.env to fetch the client secret from the environment variable
        attributes_request_method: 'GET',
        oidc_issuer: 'https://github.com', // GitHub's OIDC issuer URL
      },
      attributeMapping: {
        // Map GitHub user attributes to Cognito user pool attributes
        email: 'email',
        // Add other attribute mappings as needed
      },
    });

    // Additional CDK resources and configuration...
  }
}
```

Make sure to replace `process.env.VITE_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `process.env.VITE_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` with the actual values from your environment variables.

Also, ensure that you have the correct values for the `authorize_scopes` and `oidc_issuer` parameters based on your specific GitHub OAuth setup.

By providing the correct values for these parameters, you should be able to resolve the error and successfully deploy your CDK stack.

Based on the code you provided, it appears that you have already added the necessary code to define GitHub as an identity provider in your `cdk-stack.ts` file. Here's a summary of the relevant parts:

```typescript
// Define GitHub as an identity provider
new cognito.CfnUserPoolIdentityProvider(this, 'GitHubIdentityProvider', {
  providerName: 'GitHub', // This is the name you assign to your provider
  providerType: 'OIDC', // For GitHub, use 'OIDC' or 'SAML' as appropriate
  userPoolId: userPool.userPoolId,
  providerDetails: {
    // These will be specific to the OAuth provider
    // For GitHub, use the OAuth 2.0 endpoint information and credentials
    authorize_scopes: 'openid,profile,email',
    client_id: githubClientId,
    client_secret: githubClientSecret,
    attributes_request_method: 'GET',
    oidc_issuer: githubIssuerUrl, // This is not directly applicable to GitHub as GitHub doesn't directly support OIDC
    // You will need to adjust the above details for GitHub's OAuth flow
  },
  attributeMapping: {
    // Map GitHub user attributes to Cognito user pool attributes
    email: 'email',
    // Add other attribute mappings as needed
  },
});
```

To resolve the error you encountered, make sure that you have the correct values for the `githubClientId`, `githubClientSecret`, and `githubIssuerUrl` environment variables. These values should be fetched from your `.env` file using the `process.env` object.

Here's an example of how you can fetch these values:

```typescript
const githubClientSecret = process.env.VITE_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET;
const githubClientId = process.env.VITE_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID;
const githubIssuerUrl = process.env.VITE_GITHUB_ISSUER_URL;
```

Ensure that you have the correct values for these environment variables in your `.env` file.

If you have already made these changes and are still encountering the error, double-check that you have provided the correct values for the `authorize_scopes`, `client_id`, `client_secret`, and `oidc_issuer` parameters in the `providerDetails` object.

If the issue persists, please provide more details about the error message or any additional error logs you are encountering.

The issue you're experiencing might be related to the way Vite handles environment variables. By default, Vite does not automatically load environment variables from a `.env` file during the build process.

To make environment variables available in your CDK stack, you need to configure Vite to load the `.env` file during the build process.

Here's how you can configure Vite to load the `.env` file:

1. Open your `vite.config.ts` file.

2. Import the `dotenv` module at the top of the file:

   ```typescript
   import dotenv from 'dotenv';
   ```

3. Add the following code inside the `defineConfig` function to load the environment variables from the `.env` file:

   ```typescript
   dotenv.config();
   ```

4. Save the `vite.config.ts` file.

After making these changes, rebuild your CDK stack using the `yarn cdk-deploy` command. The environment variables should now be available in your `cdk-stack.ts` file.

Make sure that the `.env` file is located in the root directory of your project, alongside the `vite.config.ts` file.

By configuring Vite to load the `.env` file, you should be able to access the environment variables in your CDK stack.
