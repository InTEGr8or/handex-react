My AWS CDK stack is throwing this error:

```
GitHubIdentityProvider Unable to contact well-known endpoint (Service: AWSCognitoIdentityProviderService; Status Code: 400; Error Code: InvalidParameterException;
```

---

The error message you're seeing indicates that the AWS CDK stack is unable to contact the well-known endpoint for the AWS Cognito Identity Provider service. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. **Network connectivity issues**: Ensure that your network has proper connectivity to AWS services. You can try running the AWS CLI command `aws cognito-idp describe-user-pool` to check if you can access the Cognito service from your network.

2. **Service availability**: Check if the Cognito service is available in your region. You can visit the AWS status page (https://status.aws.amazon.com/) to see if there are any known issues with the Cognito service in your region.

3. **Invalid parameter**: Double-check the parameters you are passing to the AWS CDK stack. The error message suggests that there might be an invalid parameter. Make sure all the required parameters are correctly set and valid.

If none of the above suggestions resolve the issue, please provide more details about your AWS CDK stack code or the specific code causing the error, so I can assist you further.

The error you're encountering suggests that there might be an issue with the configuration of the GitHub identity provider in your AWS CDK stack. Specifically, the error message mentions "Unable to contact well-known endpoint" which typically indicates a problem with the OAuth flow.

To troubleshoot this issue, you can check the following:

1. **Verify GitHub OAuth settings**: Ensure that the GitHub OAuth application you're using has been properly configured with the correct client ID and client secret. Double-check that the OAuth callback URL is set correctly in your GitHub application settings.

2. **Check GitHub OAuth endpoint**: The error message suggests that the AWS Cognito service is unable to contact the well-known endpoint for GitHub. Make sure that the GitHub OAuth endpoint URL (`https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize`) is accessible from your network.

3. **Verify environment variables**: Ensure that the environment variables (`VITE_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`, `VITE_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`, and `VITE_GITHUB_ISSUER_URL`) are correctly set and contain the correct values.

4. **Check AWS Cognito service availability**: Verify that the AWS Cognito service is available in your region. You can visit the AWS status page (https://status.aws.amazon.com/) to see if there are any known issues with the Cognito service in your region.

If the issue persists, you may need to provide more information or debug the specific code causing the error.

Based on the responses you provided, it seems that both the GitHub app and the GitHub auth requests are returning a 200 response. This indicates that the requests are successful and the GitHub endpoints are accessible.

If you are still experiencing issues with the GitHub identity provider in your AWS CDK stack, it's possible that there might be an issue with the configuration of the identity provider or the integration with the AWS Cognito service.

To troubleshoot further, you can check the following:

1. **Verify GitHub OAuth settings**: Double-check that the GitHub OAuth application you're using has been properly configured with the correct client ID and client secret. Ensure that the OAuth callback URL is set correctly in your GitHub application settings.

2. **Check GitHub OAuth endpoint**: Ensure that the GitHub OAuth endpoint URL (`https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize`) is accessible from your network. You can try running the following command in your terminal to test the endpoint:
   ```
   curl -I https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize
   ```

3. **Verify environment variables**: Ensure that the environment variables (`VITE_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`, `VITE_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`, and `VITE_GITHUB_ISSUER_URL`) are correctly set and contain the correct values.

4. **Check AWS Cognito service availability**: Verify that the AWS Cognito service is available in your region. You can visit the AWS status page (https://status.aws.amazon.com/) to see if there are any known issues with the Cognito service in your region.

If the issue persists, you may need to provide more information or debug the specific code causing the error.

The response you received indicates that the GitHub OAuth endpoint (`https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize`) is returning a 302 response with a `Location` header that redirects to the login page (`https://github.com/login`). This is a common behavior when the OAuth flow is initiated but the user is not authenticated.

To troubleshoot the issue, you can try the following:

1. **Check GitHub OAuth settings**: Double-check that the GitHub OAuth application you're using has been properly configured with the correct client ID and client secret. Ensure that the OAuth callback URL is set correctly in your GitHub application settings.

2. **Test GitHub OAuth flow**: Try initiating the GitHub OAuth flow manually by visiting the GitHub OAuth endpoint in your browser. If you're not already logged in to GitHub, you will be redirected to the login page. After logging in, you should be redirected back to the OAuth callback URL specified in your GitHub application settings.

3. **Verify environment variables**: Ensure that the environment variables (`VITE_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`, `VITE_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`, and `VITE_GITHUB_ISSUER_URL`) are correctly set and contain the correct values.

4. **Check AWS Cognito service availability**: Verify that the AWS Cognito service is available in your region. You can visit the AWS status page (https://status.aws.amazon.com/) to see if there are any known issues with the Cognito service in your region.

If the issue persists, you may need to provide more information or debug the specific code causing the error.

To verify the GitHub OAuth settings using the GitHub CLI, you can use the `gh auth login` command. Here are the steps:

1. Install the GitHub CLI if you haven't already. You can find the installation instructions for your operating system on the GitHub CLI documentation page: [https://cli.github.com/](https://cli.github.com/).

2. Open a terminal or command prompt.

3. Run the following command to authenticate with GitHub:
   ```
   gh auth login
   ```

4. Follow the prompts to enter your GitHub username and password.

5. After successful authentication, you can verify the OAuth settings by running the following command:
   ```
   gh auth list
   ```

   This command will display a list of all the authenticated GitHub accounts on your machine. Look for the entry corresponding to your GitHub OAuth application.

6. Check the `Host` and `Token` values for the OAuth application. The `Host` value should be `github.com` and the `Token` value should be a valid access token.

If the `Token` value is missing or invalid, you may need to reconfigure the GitHub OAuth application or regenerate the access token.

Note that the GitHub CLI requires authentication with your GitHub account to access OAuth settings. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to manage the OAuth application.

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, please let me know.

I apologize for the confusion. It seems that the `gh auth list` command is not available in the GitHub CLI.

To verify the GitHub OAuth settings using the GitHub CLI, you can use the `gh auth status` command. Here are the steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Run the following command to check the authentication status:
   ```
   gh auth status
   ```

   This command will display the authentication status for each GitHub account on your machine.

3. Look for the entry corresponding to your GitHub OAuth application.

4. Check the `Host` and `Token` values for the OAuth application. The `Host` value should be `github.com` and the `Token` value should be a valid access token.

If the `Token` value is missing or invalid, you may need to reconfigure the GitHub OAuth application or regenerate the access token.

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, please let me know.
