This `cdk/lambda/authentication/signUp.ts` provides the server-side sign-up feature for my React static website hosted on GitHub Pages.

```ts
// cdk/lambda/authentication/signUp.ts

const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
const cognito = new AWS.CognitoIdentityServiceProvider({ region: 'us-east-1' });

exports.handler = async (event: { body: string; }) => {
 console.log("signUp function called");
 console.log('Received event:', event); // Log the incoming event

 try {
  const { username, password, email } = JSON.parse(event.body);
  console.log(`Processing signUp for username: ${username}, email: ${email}`); // Log the extracted variables

  var params = {
   ClientId: process.env.COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_ID,
   Username: username,
   Password: password,
   UserAttributes: [
    {
     Name: 'email',
     Value: email
    },
   ],
  };

  const data = await cognito.signUp(params).promise();
  console.log('SignUp success:', JSON.stringify(data)); // Log successful signup
  // Include CORS headers in the successful response
  return {
   statusCode: 200,
   headers: {
    "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*", // Adjust this value based on your requirements
    "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials": true, // If your client needs to handle cookies
   },

    "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials": true, // If your client needs to handle cookies
   },
   body: JSON.stringify(err.message)
  };
 }
};
```

Now I want to create a sign-in, sign-out, and change-password features and I need your help doing that.

**Codeium** _at 10:25 pm, Jun 29, 2024_

To complement your sign-up feature with sign-in, sign-out, and change-password functionalities using AWS Lambda and Amazon Cognito, you can create separate Lambda functions for each. Below are the TypeScript templates for these functions, assuming you're using the AWS SDK v2.x.

### Sign-In Function

This function will authenticate a user with Cognito.

```ts
// cdk/lambda/authentication/signIn.ts

import * as AWS from 'aws-sdk';

const cognito = new AWS.CognitoIdentityServiceProvider({ region: 'us-east-1' });

exports.handler = async (event: { body: string }) => {
  try {
    const { username, password } = JSON.parse(event.body);
    const params = {
      AuthFlow: 'USER_PASSWORD_AUTH',
      ClientId: process.env.COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_ID,
      AuthParameters: {
        USERNAME: username,
        PASSWORD: password,
      },
    };

    const data = await cognito.initiateAuth(params).promise();
    console.log('SignIn success:', JSON.stringify(data));
    return {
      statusCode: 200,
      headers: {
        "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
        "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials": true,
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(data.AuthenticationResult),
    };
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('SignIn error:', err);
    return {
      statusCode: 400,
      headers: {
        "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
        "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials": true,
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(err.message),
    };
  }
};
```

### Sign-Out Function

AWS Cognito doesn't require a specific sign-out call for server-side operations since tokens are managed on the client side. You can invalidate tokens simply by not using them or by using the `globalSignOut` method for a more comprehensive approach.

### Change-Password Function

This function allows authenticated users to change their password.

```ts
// cdk/lambda/authentication/changePassword.ts

import * as AWS from 'aws-sdk';

const cognito = new AWS.CognitoIdentityServiceProvider({ region: 'us-east-1' });

exports.handler = async (event: { body: string }) => {
  try {
    const { accessToken, previousPassword, proposedPassword } = JSON.parse(event.body);
    const params = {
      AccessToken: accessToken, // The current user's access token
      PreviousPassword: previousPassword,
      ProposedPassword: proposedPassword,
    };

    const data = await cognito.changePassword(params).promise();
    console.log('ChangePassword success:', JSON.stringify(data));
    return {
      statusCode: 200,
      headers: {
        "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
        "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials": true,
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ message: 'Password changed successfully' }),
    };
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('ChangePassword error:', err);
    return {
      statusCode: 400,
      headers: {
        "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
        "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials": true,
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(err.message),
    };
  }
};
```

### Notes:

- Ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your IAM role that executes these Lambda functions.
- Adjust the `"Access-Control-Allow-Origin"` header value to match your application's domain for better security.
- Store sensitive information like `COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_ID` securely, for example, in environment variables or AWS Secrets Manager.
- These examples use promise-based async/await syntax for handling asynchronous operations, which is supported in Node.js 8.x and later.

This TypeScript error indicates a type mismatch with the AWS SDK's expected parameters for the `initiateAuth` function. Specifically, the `ClientId` parameter is expected to be a string, but it could potentially be `undefined` in your code because it's fetched from `process.env.COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_ID`, which TypeScript treats as possibly `undefined`.

To resolve this issue, you need to assert that `ClientId` is not `undefined` before using it in your AWS SDK call. Here's how you can do it:

```ts
// cdk/lambda/authentication/signIn.ts

import * as AWS from 'aws-sdk';

const cognito = new AWS.CognitoIdentityServiceProvider({ region: 'us-east-1' });

exports.handler = async (event: { body: string }) => {
  try {
    const { username, password } = JSON.parse(event.body);
    // Ensure ClientId is a string and not undefined
    const clientId = process.env.COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_ID;
    if (!clientId) {
      throw new Error('COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_ID environment variable is not set.');
    }
    const params = {
      AuthFlow: 'USER_PASSWORD_AUTH',
      ClientId: clientId,
      AuthParameters: {
        USERNAME: username,
        PASSWORD: password,
      },
    };

    const data = await cognito.initiateAuth(params).promise();
    console.log('SignIn success:', JSON.stringify(data));
    return {
      statusCode: 200,
      headers: {
        "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
        "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials": true,
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(data.AuthenticationResult),
    };
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('SignIn error:', err);
    return {
      statusCode: 400,
      headers: {
        "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
        "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials": true,
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(err.message),
    };
  }
};
```

This solution checks if the `COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_ID` is not set and explicitly throws an error if it is `undefined`. This ensures that the `ClientId` parameter passed to the `initiateAuth` call is always a string, as expected by the AWS SDK, thus resolving the type mismatch error.

**User** _at 7:07 am, Jun 30, 2024_

I had a big problem with a  URL typo. The `signup` URL was written with `signUp`, which caused a problem for the token validating code.

My `useAuth` client-side code needs to carefully match any URL endpoints created in the CDK code.

What are some common tools that can help with that? I am thinking of using a Type or Enum or a combination of both that could make the strings more modular, but I have heard that there are some commonly used tools for doing that.

---

**Codeium** _at 7:08 am, Jun 30, 2024_

To ensure consistency and reduce errors in URL endpoints between your client-side and server-side code, using TypeScript types or enums is a great idea. Additionally, there are tools and practices that can help you manage and synchronize these endpoints more effectively:

### 1. TypeScript Enums or Constants

Define your API endpoints in a TypeScript file as enums or constants. This approach allows you to import these values in both your client-side and server-side code, assuming both parts of your application can share TypeScript files.

```typescript
// src/apiEndpoints.ts
export enum ApiEndpoints {
  SignUp = "/signup",
  SignIn = "/signin",
  SignOut = "/signout",
  ChangePassword = "/changePassword",
}
```

### 2. Environment Configuration Files

Use environment configuration files to store your API endpoints. Libraries like `dotenv` for Node.js can load these values at runtime. However, this approach is more suitable for server-side code or for build-time inclusion in client-side projects.

### 3. API Management Tools

Consider using an API management tool or service like Swagger (OpenAPI). These tools allow you to define your API endpoints in a YAML or JSON file. Swagger tools can generate client libraries in various programming languages, ensuring consistency between your server and client code.

### 4. Shared NPM Package

If your client and server are both written in JavaScript or TypeScript, consider creating a shared NPM package that includes common types, interfaces, enums, and constants. Both client and server projects can then include this package as a dependency.

### 5. Code Generation Tools

There are tools available that can generate API clients from your server definitions. For example, if you're using OpenAPI for your API definition, tools like Swagger Codegen or OpenAPI Generator can generate client libraries for TypeScript, ensuring that your client is always in sync with your server API.

### 6. GraphQL

If you're using GraphQL, this problem is significantly reduced. GraphQL clients like Apollo can automatically generate hooks and interfaces for your client code based on the GraphQL schema, which is shared between client and server.

### Conclusion

Each of these approaches has its own set of benefits and trade-offs. Choosing the right one depends on your project's specific needs, the technologies you're using, and how much flexibility you need in managing your API endpoints. For a TypeScript-based project, starting with TypeScript enums or constants is a simple and effective way to ensure consistency across your codebase.

**User** _at 7:11 am, Jun 30, 2024_

TypeScript constants looks promising. I am using Yarn and Vite, and I know that Vite has some kind of tool that replaces `dotenv`. I am using Vite for the outer React app, but I need anything I use to also work with the AWS CDK code that is TypeScript and Yarn, but not VIte.

---

**Codeium** _at 7:11 am, Jun 30, 2024_

Given your setup using Vite for a React app and a separate AWS CDK project for infrastructure, you'll want a solution that allows for sharing configuration between these two parts of your project without relying solely on Vite's environment variable handling. Here's how you can approach this:

### Using TypeScript Constants across Projects

1. **Shared Configuration File**: Create a shared TypeScript file that contains constants for API endpoints or any other shared configuration. Place this file in a directory that's accessible by both your Vite project and your AWS CDK project.

    ```typescript
    // shared/config.ts
    export const config = {
      API_ENDPOINTS: {
        SignUp: "/signup",
        SignIn: "/signin",
        SignOut: "/signout",
        ChangePassword: "/changePassword",
      },
    };
    ```

2. **Import in AWS CDK and React App**: Use these constants in both your AWS CDK code and your React app by importing the shared configuration file.

    In your CDK stack:
    ```typescript
    import { config } from '../path/to/shared/config';

    const signInResource = api.root.addResource(config.API_ENDPOINTS.SignIn);
    ```

    In your React app:
    ```typescript
    import { config } from '../path/to/shared/config';

    const signInUrl = `${API_BASE_URL}${config.API_ENDPOINTS.SignIn}`;
    ```

### Environment Variables in Vite and CDK

Vite replaces `dotenv` for environment variable management in the context of Vite projects. However, you can still use `.env` files or similar in your CDK project and load these values in a way that's consistent across both projects.

1. **Environment Variables in CDK**: You can manually load `.env` files in your CDK project using the `dotenv` package.

    First, install `dotenv` in your CDK project:
    ```shell
    yarn add dotenv
    ```
    
    Then, load environment variables early in your CDK entry point:
    ```typescript
    import * as dotenv from 'dotenv';
    dotenv.config();
    
    // Now process.env will contain your environment variables
    ```

2. **Environment Variables in Vite**: Vite automatically loads environment variables from `.env` files and makes them available in your project through `import.meta.env`.

3. **Shared `.env` Files**: You can place your `.env` files in a shared location if it makes sense for your project structure, but you'll need to ensure both Vite and your CDK scripts are configured to look in the correct location for these files.

### Conclusion

While Vite and the AWS CDK serve different parts of your application, you can achieve configuration sharing through a combination of shared TypeScript constants for compile-time values and environment variables for runtime configuration. This setup allows you to maintain consistency across both your frontend and infrastructure codebases.

**User** _at 7:17 am, Jun 30, 2024_

Actually, I now remember that AWS CDK already provides access to `process.env` variables. I think I just have to name evertying `VITE_` in order to work with Vite.

It seems like that might clutter the environment variables file to put all the API endpoints in there, though, and the Enum/constants might be cleaner, as long as I can  share them easily between the two projects, one of which is nested inside the other. The CDK is in a subdirectory.

---

**Codeium** _at 7:18 am, Jun 30, 2024_

Given your structure, where the AWS CDK project is nested inside a larger project that also includes your Vite-based React app, and considering your intention to keep things clean and manageable, using TypeScript constants or enums for your API endpoints is indeed a cleaner and more maintainable approach than populating the environment file with numerous endpoint definitions. Here's how you can organize and share these constants effectively between your projects:

### Organizing Shared Constants

1. **Create a Shared Constants File**: Place this file in a location accessible by both the Vite project and the AWS CDK subproject. Given your project structure, you might want to place this file at a common root level or within a specific `shared` directory that makes logical sense for your project.

    ```typescript
    // shared/apiEndpoints.ts
    export const API_ENDPOINTS = {
      SignUp: "/signup",
      SignIn: "/signin",
      SignOut: "/signout",
      ChangePassword: "/changePassword",
    };
    ```

2. **Use Constants in the AWS CDK Project**: Import the shared constants into your AWS CDK TypeScript files as needed. Since the CDK project is a subdirectory of your main project, you can import the constants using a relative path that navigates up to the shared location.

    ```typescript
    // cdk/lib/my-stack.ts
    import { API_ENDPOINTS } from '../../shared/apiEndpoints';

    const signUpResource = api.root.addResource(API_ENDPOINTS.SignUp);
    ```

3. **Use Constants in the Vite/React Project**: Similarly, you can import the shared constants into your React components or any other part of your Vite project. The import path will depend on where the shared constants file is located relative to the file that's using it.

    ```typescript
    // src/App.tsx
    import { API_ENDPOINTS } from '../shared/apiEndpoints';

    const signUpUrl = `${process.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL}${API_ENDPOINTS.SignUp}`;
    ```

### Ensuring Accessibility

Since one project is nested within another, the key is to place your shared constants in a location that's logically outside of the nested project's directory but still within the scope of the parent project. This way, both the parent (Vite/React app) and the child (AWS CDK subproject) can access the shared constants without duplication.

### Version Control

Make sure your shared constants file is tracked by your version control system. This ensures that any updates to the API endpoints are synchronized across both your frontend and backend whenever you make changes and pull those changes across your development environments.

### Summary

By organizing your API endpoints into a shared TypeScript constants file, you can easily maintain and access these endpoints across both your AWS CDK and Vite projects, keeping your configuration clean and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). This method also avoids cluttering your environment files with static configuration details that are better managed as code.

**User** _at 8:54 am, Jun 30, 2024_

I ended up doing this:

```ts
// shared/endpoints.ts

const ENDPOINTS = {
  aws: {
    cognito: {
      url: 'https://cognito-idp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com',
    },
    s3: {
      url: 'https://s3.amazonaws.com',
      bucketName: 'handterm-history',
    },
  },
  api: {
    SignUp: '/signUp',
    GetLog: '/getLog',
    SaveLog: '/saveLog',
    SignIn: '/signIn',
    SignOut: '/signOut',
    ChangePassword: '/changePassword',
    TokenHandler: '/tokenHandler',
    RefreshSession: '/refreshSession',
    CheckSession: '/checkSession',
    GetUser: '/getUser',
  }

} as const
export default ENDPOINTS
```

What will happen when I `yarn deploy` in the `cdk/` when the modules import like this?

```ts
import ENDPOINTS from '../../shared/endpoints';
```

---

**Codeium** _at 8:54 am, Jun 30, 2024_

When you run `yarn deploy` in the `cdk/` directory, the AWS CDK will attempt to deploy your infrastructure based on your TypeScript files, including importing constants from your `shared/endpoints.ts` file. Here's what happens behind the scenes and some considerations:

### TypeScript Compilation

1. **Compilation**: The TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) will compile your TypeScript files into JavaScript. During this process, it will follow the `import` statements to include the necessary code from your `shared/endpoints.ts` in the compiled output. The relative path `../../shared/endpoints` is resolved during this compilation step based on your project's structure.

2. **Node.js Resolution**: The compiled JavaScript files will then be executed by Node.js (or another JavaScript runtime environment) as part of the deployment process. Node.js follows the CommonJS module resolution strategy, which means it will look for the `shared/endpoints.js` file relative to the file that contains the `import` (or `require`, post-compilation) statement.

### Deployment

Assuming the compiled JavaScript code is correct and the file paths are resolved properly, `yarn deploy` will execute your CDK stack's deployment scripts, which will in turn create or update resources in AWS based on the definitions in your CDK code.

### Considerations

- **Path Correctness**: Ensure the relative path in the `import` statement correctly points to the location of `shared/endpoints.ts` relative to the TypeScript file that's importing it. Since you're running `yarn deploy` from the `cdk/` directory, your paths seem to be correctly set up to go up two levels (`../../`) and then down into the `shared/` directory.

- **Compilation Configuration**: Make sure your `tsconfig.json` in the `cdk/` directory is correctly configured to handle your project structure, including the `shared/` directory. You may need to adjust the `include` or `paths` configurations to ensure proper compilation.

- **Deployment Script**: The `yarn deploy` command typically runs a script defined in your `package.json`. Verify that this script correctly invokes the AWS CDK deployment commands (`cdk deploy`) and that any necessary environment variables or configurations are properly set.

- **Version Control and Consistency**: Ensure that your `shared/endpoints.ts` file is version-controlled and that changes to it are synchronized across your team to prevent inconsistencies in your deployments.

By organizing shared configuration in this manner and ensuring the correct setup of your TypeScript and CDK configurations, you can maintain a single source of truth for your endpoints and other shared constants across both your CDK infrastructure code and your application code.

**Codeium** _at 9:04 am, Jun 30, 2024_

The error message you're encountering indicates that the Node.js runtime is treating your `endpoints.ts` file as an ES module due to the presence of `"type": "module"` in your package.json, but `ts-node` (used by the AWS CDK for executing TypeScript code) is attempting to `require()` it, which is not supported for ES modules.

This issue arises from a conflict between CommonJS and ES Module (ESM) systems. Your project is configured to use ESM, but `ts-node` and, by extension, the AWS CDK are trying to load your code using CommonJS semantics.

### Solutions

To resolve this issue, you have a few options:

#### 1. Convert `import` to CommonJS `require` in CDK Code (Not Ideal)

This approach isn't directly applicable here since the underlying issue is about importing ESM modules into a CommonJS context, which is inherently problematic.

#### 2. Use `.js` Extension with Type Definitions

One workaround is to change your `endpoints.ts` to a `.js` file with accompanying `.d.ts` type definitions. This allows Node.js to correctly handle the file as an ES module, but it requires maintaining separate type definitions.

1. Rename `endpoints.ts` to `endpoints.js` and update it to be a valid ES module.
2. Create `endpoints.d.ts` with the type definitions for your endpoints.

This approach keeps the ES module but requires you to maintain TypeScript types separately, which can be error-prone.

#### 3. Remove `"type": "module"` from Your `package.json`

If your project structure allows, removing `"type": "module"` from your `package.json` will default `.js` files to CommonJS. You would then ensure that your TypeScript files compile to CommonJS modules, which `ts-node` can handle. However, this might not be feasible depending on other project requirements.

#### 4. Use a Build Step for Your CDK Code

Another approach is to compile your TypeScript CDK code into JavaScript using a build step before deployment. This process involves setting up a TypeScript configuration that compiles your CDK TypeScript code (and any imported modules like your `endpoints.ts`) into CommonJS modules.

1. Add a build script in your `cdk/package.json` to compile the TypeScript code.
2. Use the compiled JavaScript output for deployment with the CDK.

This approach might look like this in your `cdk/package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "tsc --project tsconfig.json",
  "deploy": "yarn build && cdk deploy"
}
```

And ensure your `tsconfig.json` in the CDK directory is set to compile to CommonJS:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "CommonJS"
  }
}
```

#### 5. Explicitly Define Module Resolution

Since your setup includes mixed module types (ESM for the frontend and potentially CommonJS for Node.js/CDK), consider explicitly defining module resolution where needed. This might involve configuring webpack, TypeScript, or Babel to handle ESM imports explicitly.

### Conclusion

The choice of solution depends on your project's specific setup and requirements. For many, adding a build step to the CDK project is the most straightforward way to ensure compatibility without altering the global module configuration of the project.

If I remove `"type": "module"` I get:

```ts

Uncaught (in promise) SyntaxError: The requested module '/shared/endpoints.js' does not provide an export named 'ENDPOINTS' (at useAuth.ts:3:9)
```

**Codeium** _at 9:13 am, Jun 30, 2024_

The error you're encountering after removing `"type": "module"` from your `package.json` suggests that the front-end part of your application, which likely runs in a more modern environment capable of understanding ES modules, is now having trouble importing the ES module because the environment defaults to treating JavaScript files as CommonJS modules without `"type": "module"`.

Given this situation, and to accommodate both your AWS CDK backend and Vite-based front end, you might consider a couple of approaches to ensure compatibility across both environments:

### Approach 1: Dual Package Hazard Solution

Create two versions of your `endpoints` module: one as an ES module and one as a CommonJS module. This approach helps avoid the dual package hazard where some parts of your application expect CommonJS and others expect ESM.

- **ES Module (`endpoints.js` and `endpoints.mjs`)**: Keep the ES module format for the front end. You might also rename it to `endpoints.mjs` to explicitly mark it as an ES module.

- **CommonJS Module (`endpoints.cjs`)**: Create a CommonJS version of the `endpoints` module for the AWS CDK part of your application.

You then import the appropriate version based on the consumer of the module. This approach requires maintaining two versions of the file, but it can be automated as part of your build process.

### Approach 2: TypeScript Configuration for ES Module Interop

Adjust your TypeScript configuration to better handle ES module interop, allowing TypeScript to generate code that works with both module systems.

1. **Frontend (Vite Project)**: Ensure your `tsconfig.json` or `vite.config.ts` is set up to handle ES modules correctly. Vite and modern browsers handle ES modules natively, so your current setup should already be compatible.

2. **Backend (AWS CDK Project)**: Configure the TypeScript compiler to generate compatible code for imports. In your `tsconfig.json` for the CDK project, you might want to ensure settings like `"module": "CommonJS"` and `"esModuleInterop": true` are present.

    ```json
    {
      "compilerOptions": {
        "module": "CommonJS",
        "esModuleInterop": true,
        "outDir": "lib",
        "rootDir": "src",
        // other options...
      }
    }
    ```

### Approach 3: Import Adjustments

For the specific case of importing `endpoints.js`:

- **Update Import Paths**: If you're using TypeScript and your project is set up to compile to both ES Module and CommonJS targets, make sure your import statements are correctly pointing to the compiled JavaScript files. TypeScript should handle the module resolution, but you might need to adjust the import paths or extensions depending on your build setup.

- **Dynamic Imports**: As a workaround, consider using dynamic imports in your frontend code, which are supported in both CommonJS and ES Module contexts. This approach can be particularly useful if you're dealing with conditional imports or need to ensure compatibility across different module systems.

    ```typescript
    // Dynamically import the ENDPOINTS
    const { ENDPOINTS } = await import('/shared/endpoints.js');
    ```

### Conclusion

Each of these approaches has trade-offs in terms of maintainability, build complexity, and runtime behavior. Given the mixed environment of your project (AWS CDK for backend and Vite for frontend), maintaining compatibility between CommonJS and ES Module systems requires careful setup of your TypeScript and JavaScript modules.

For a solution that minimizes maintenance and build complexity, I recommend starting with **Approach 2** to adjust your TypeScript configuration for better module interop, and then considering **Approach 1** if you have specific needs that require maintaining separate module formats.

I'm attempting to use your ES Module Interop suggestion.

---

**Codeium** _at 9:47 am, Jun 30, 2024_

Given your setup and the error you're encountering, it seems that the issue persists because of the way Node.js, TypeScript, and `ts-node` handle ES Modules (ESM) and CommonJS (CJS) interoperability. Your CDK project is in TypeScript and you're attempting to import an ES Module (`shared/endpoints.ts`) from a CommonJS context created by `ts-node`.

Here's a step-by-step guide to diagnose and potentially resolve the issue:

### Diagnosing the Issue

1. **Verify TypeScript Compilation**: Ensure that your TypeScript files are being compiled correctly by manually running the build script with `yarn build` in your `cdk` directory. This process should generate JavaScript files in the CommonJS format, as specified in your `tsconfig.json`.

2. **Check `ts-node` Version**: The version of `ts-node` you are using (`"^10.9.2"`) should generally support ESM, but there can be nuances depending on how your environment is set up. Ensure you have the latest version or consider using the `--loader ts-node/esm` flag if running a version of Node.js that supports it.

### Possible Solutions

#### Adjusting the Import Method

Since direct import of an ES Module into a CommonJS context is problematic, consider dynamically importing your `shared/endpoints.ts` using an asynchronous import. This method is supported in both CommonJS and ES Module contexts:

```typescript
// Dynamically import the ES Module
const endpoints = await import('../../shared/endpoints');
```

This requires making the surrounding context asynchronous, which might not always be feasible depending on where and how you're importing the module.

#### Ensuring Correct Module Resolution

In your `cdk/tsconfig.json`, you've specified `"module": "CommonJS"`, which is correct for AWS CDK projects. However, the error suggests that `ts-node` might not be using this configuration or is having trouble resolving the module format at runtime. You can try specifying the `TS_NODE_PROJECT` environment variable to explicitly tell `ts-node` which `tsconfig.json` to use:

```powershell
$env:TS_NODE_PROJECT = "./cdk/tsconfig.json"
cdk deploy --region us-east-1 --profile mark
```

#### Using a Pre-Compilation Step

As a more robust workaround, consider pre-compiling your TypeScript CDK project to JavaScript using `tsc` and then running the CDK commands on the compiled JavaScript. This approach circumvents the `ts-node` module resolution issues by working directly with JavaScript files:

1. Run the build script: `yarn build` in your `cdk` directory to compile the TypeScript files to JavaScript.
2. Adjust your CDK scripts to run against the compiled JavaScript output instead of directly invoking TypeScript files.

#### Reviewing Project Structure

Given that removing `"type": "module"` led to import issues in your Vite project, and reintroducing it causes issues in your CDK project, you may need to carefully balance the project structure and tooling configurations to ensure compatibility. This might involve separating the CDK and Vite projects more distinctly or using build and deployment scripts that adjust the environment or compile options accordingly.

### Conclusion

Interoperability issues between ES Modules and CommonJS can be complex, especially when working across different parts of a project with varying requirements. If these solutions do not resolve the issue, it might be helpful to consider isolating the CDK and Vite projects further or using containerization or virtualization tools to standardize the environment each part of your project runs in.

I think the `ts-node` version is in the `package.json` I just posted above. Yes, here it is:

```json
  "ts-node": "^10.9.2",
```

This is what I get from `yarn build` in the `cdk/`:

```powershell

yarn run v1.22.22
$ tsc -p ./tsconfig.json

**Codeium** _at 9:51 am, Jun 30, 2024_

Given that the `yarn build` command in the `cdk/` directory successfully compiles your TypeScript code, it appears that your TypeScript setup and configuration are correct for compiling TypeScript to JavaScript. The issue arises when attempting to run the CDK commands directly, which involve `ts-node` interpreting your TypeScript files, including the problematic import from an ES module in a CommonJS context.

Your `ts-node` version, `^10.9.2`, should generally support importing ES Modules, but the error you're encountering suggests a conflict between the expected module formats. This conflict is likely due to the interplay between Node.js's handling of ES Modules and the CommonJS module system expected by `ts-node` and the AWS CDK.

### Addressing the Issue

Given the successful compilation with `tsc`, one way to work around the issue with `ts-node` and ES Module imports is to adjust how you run the CDK commands to either bypass the need for `ts-node` to interpret ES Module imports directly or ensure it handles them correctly.

#### Option 1: Run CDK Commands Against Compiled JavaScript

Since your TypeScript compiles successfully, consider adjusting your workflow to run CDK commands against the compiled JavaScript output. This approach bypasses `ts-node` for running your CDK application:

1. **Modify the CDK Script in `package.json`**: Change your script to run CDK commands against the compiled JavaScript output in your `cdk/` directory.

    Before:
    ```json
    "cdk": "cdk"
    ```

    After (assuming your compiled JavaScript is output to a `dist` or similar directory within `cdk/`):
    ```json
    "cdk": "cd dist && cdk"
    ```

2. **Run Your CDK Deploy Command**: Use the modified script to run your deploy command, ensuring it uses the compiled JavaScript output.

    ```powershell
    yarn cdk deploy --region us-east-1 --profile mark
    ```

This method requires you to compile your TypeScript code before running CDK commands, but it ensures that the runtime environment is consistent and compatible with the CommonJS module system.

#### Option 2: Configure `ts-node` for ES Module Support

Another approach is to explicitly configure `ts-node` to better handle ES Module syntax. This can involve setting environment variables or updating your `tsconfig.json` to ensure `ts-node` correctly interprets ES Module imports:

- **Use the `--loader` Flag**: For Node.js versions that support it, you can use the `--loader ts-node/esm` flag to run your TypeScript files with ES Module support.

- **Check Node.js Version**: Ensure you're using a version of Node.js that supports ES Modules natively and aligns with `ts-node`'s requirements for such support.

- **Review `tsconfig.json` Settings**: Double-check that your `tsconfig.json` settings in the `cdk/` directory are optimized for `ts-node`'s use, including setting `"module": "CommonJS"` and ensuring `"esModuleInterop": true` is present.

### Conclusion

Given the complexities involved with module formats and the tooling ecosystem around TypeScript, Node.js, and the AWS CDK, finding the right configuration and workflow can be challenging. The first option provides a more immediate workaround by leveraging the compiled JavaScript directly for CDK operations, while the second option involves deeper configuration adjustments to align `ts-node`'s behavior with your project's needs.

The error you're encountering during the Vite build process relates to the use of top-level `await` in an environment that Vite's esbuild configuration deems incompatible with this feature. This incompatibility arises because top-level `await` is a relatively new addition to the JavaScript language and may not be supported in all the target environments specified in your Vite and TypeScript configuration.

Here are a few steps to address this issue:

### 1. Review `tsconfig.json` for the Frontend

Ensure that your `tsconfig.json` for the frontend project (the parent directory where you run Vite) targets an ECMAScript version that supports top-level `await`. For instance, ensure your `target` is set to `"ESNext"` or at least `"ES2020"`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ESNext",
    // other options...
  }
}
```

### 2. Adjust Vite Configuration

Check your `vite.config.ts` (or `vite.config.js`) file to ensure that the build targets are correctly set to allow for top-level `await`. You might need to explicitly configure the `build.target` field:

```js
// vite.config.ts or vite.config.js
export default defineConfig({
  build: {
    // Set to a higher version that supports top-level await
    target: 'esnext',
  },
  // other configurations...
});
```

### 3. Review Dynamic Import Usage

The error log suggests that the issue is with how the dynamic import is being transpiled. If adjusting the target environments does not resolve the issue, consider reviewing how you're using dynamic imports, especially with top-level `await`. Make sure that the usage of dynamic imports and `await` is consistent with your application's logic and that it does not inadvertently break in older environments.

### 4. Testing and Compatibility

After making these changes, test your application thoroughly to ensure that it behaves as expected across the environments you intend to support. Keep in mind that while targeting newer ECMAScript versions enables newer language features like top-level `await`, it may reduce compatibility with older browsers or environments.

### 5. Update Dependencies

Ensure all related dependencies, including Vite, esbuild, and TypeScript, are updated to their latest versions to take advantage of recent fixes and improvements related to module handling and language features.

```shell
yarn upgrade vite esbuild typescript --latest
```

### Conclusion

The issue you're facing is related to configuration settings that influence how JavaScript features, such as top-level `await`, are transpiled and supported across different environments. By adjusting your TypeScript and Vite configurations to target environments that support these features, and ensuring your project's dependencies are up-to-date, you can resolve the build errors and maintain compatibility.

The error you're seeing suggests that Vite (via esbuild) is attempting to transpile your code for environments that do not support top-level await, despite `"type": "module"` being present in your `package.json`. This issue typically indicates a misconfiguration or misunderstanding of how Vite determines its build targets and how it integrates with TypeScript.

Here are steps to further troubleshoot and potentially resolve the issue:

### 1. Explicitly Set Vite's Build Target

In your `vite.config.ts`, ensure you're explicitly setting the build target to a version that supports top-level await. This setting informs Vite (and esbuild, which it uses for bundling and transpilation) of the JavaScript features it can assume are supported by the target environments.

```js
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';

export default defineConfig({
  build: {
    target: 'esnext',
  },
});
```

The `esnext` target is the most forward-compatible setting, indicating the latest version of ECMAScript, which includes support for top-level await.

### 2. Review and Adjust TypeScript Configuration

Top-level await is supported in ECMAScript modules (ESM) and is available in environments that support ES modules. Ensure your TypeScript configuration (`tsconfig.json`) targets a module system and ECMAScript version that align with this:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ESNext",
    "module": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "node"
  }
}
```

This configuration ensures TypeScript emits code that uses modern JavaScript features, assuming the runtime supports them.

### 3. Check Environment Targets

The error message includes a list of browsers (`"chrome87", "edge88", "es2020", "firefox78", "safari14"`), suggesting that Vite's final build is being optimized for compatibility with these browsers. If your application is intended to run in environments where these browsers' versions are relevant, you may need to reconsider the use of top-level await or include polyfills and transformations for features not supported in these environments.

### 4. Debugging and Additional Configuration

- **Debugging Build Process**: Run Vite in verbose mode to get more insight into the build process and potentially identify why it's targeting older environments. This can often reveal misconfigurations or overlooked settings.

- **Vite Plugin Compatibility**: If you're using additional plugins with Vite, double-check their compatibility with ESNext features and their configurations. Plugin misconfigurations can sometimes lead to unexpected transpilation targets or behaviors.

### 5. Clean Install and Cache Clearing

Issues with dependencies or stale caches can sometimes cause unexpected behavior:

```shell
rm -rf node_modules/.vite
rm -rf node_modules
yarn install
yarn build
```

Clearing the cache and reinstalling node modules ensures that your build starts with a clean slate, removing any potential issues caused by outdated or corrupted packages.

### Conclusion

The error indicates a conflict between the expected support for top-level await and the environments targeted by your build process. By carefully reviewing and adjusting your Vite and TypeScript configurations to ensure they're aligned with the ECMAScript features you're using (like top-level await), you can resolve these build errors and achieve the desired level of compatibility and feature support in your final build.

The error message you're encountering during the build process is because Vite (which uses Rollup internally for its build process) cannot find the named export `ENDPOINTS` in the file `shared/endpoints.js`. This issue typically occurs due to one of the following reasons:

1. **Incorrect Export Syntax**: The file `shared/endpoints.js` might not be exporting `ENDPOINTS` correctly, or the syntax used for exporting doesn't create a named export as expected.
2. **File Path or Module Resolution Issue**: The path provided in the import statement might be incorrect, or there's an issue with how Vite resolves the module.
3. **File Format or Content Issue**: If `shared/endpoints.js` is using ES module syntax (e.g., `export const ENDPOINTS = ...`), ensure that the content matches what's expected and that the file is indeed being treated as an ES module by both TypeScript and Vite.

### Troubleshooting and Solutions

#### Verify the Export in `shared/endpoints.js`

First, ensure that `shared/endpoints.js` (or `shared/endpoints.ts` if you're using TypeScript) is correctly exporting the `ENDPOINTS` constant using named export syntax:

```javascript
// Correct syntax for named export
export const ENDPOINTS = {
  // your endpoints configuration
};
```

If you recently switched from a default export (`export default ENDPOINTS;`) to a named export, make sure to update all import statements accordingly.

#### Check the File Path

Ensure that the path in the import statement correctly points to `shared/endpoints.js` relative to `src/lib/useAuth.ts`. Given the file structure you've described, the path appears correct, but it's worth double-checking. Also, ensure there are no typos in the file name or path.

#### Module Resolution Configuration

Vite and TypeScript might have different module resolution configurations, leading to inconsistencies in how paths are resolved. You can explicitly configure Vite's resolver to ensure it correctly finds your modules:

```javascript
// vite.config.js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import path from 'path';

export default defineConfig({
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      // Adjust the alias according to your project structure
      '/shared/': path.resolve(__dirname, './shared/')
    }
  },
});
```

#### Check File Format and Content

If `shared/endpoints.js` is still a TypeScript file (`.ts`) and not being correctly transpiled to JavaScript, or if there's a discrepancy in how the file is being interpreted (as an ES module vs. CommonJS), this could cause the issue. Ensure the file is correctly formatted and its exports match the expected ES module syntax.

#### Transpile TypeScript Before Importing

If `shared/endpoints` is a TypeScript file, ensure it is being transpiled to JavaScript before it's imported by Vite. Typically, Vite handles TypeScript files automatically, but there could be configuration issues preventing this.

### Conclusion

The error message indicates a mismatch between the expected and actual exports of `shared/endpoints.js`, or an issue with how Vite resolves or interprets the file. By verifying the export syntax, checking the file path and module resolution, and ensuring the file format and content are correct, you should be able to resolve the build error.

**Codeium** _at 10:15 am, Jun 30, 2024_

Given the provided `shared/endpoints.ts` content and the error you're encountering, your `ENDPOINTS` export looks correctly defined as a named export in TypeScript. The issue, therefore, seems to lie elsewhere. Given the details, here are a few revised suggestions to troubleshoot and potentially solve your problem:

### 1. Verify Import Path
Ensure the import path in `src/lib/useAuth.ts` correctly points to the `shared/endpoints.ts`. Given the information provided, your import statement seems to attempt to navigate up two directories and then into the `shared` directory. Double-check that this relative path accurately reflects the structure of your project.

### 2. TypeScript Compilation
Since you're importing from a `.ts` file outside of Vite's root (which appears to be the case given the error message and your project structure), ensure that Vite is configured to handle this. Vite typically relies on the project's `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript options but might not handle files outside its root directory in the same way as those within it.

You might consider compiling `shared/endpoints.ts` to JavaScript as part of your build process, and then importing from the compiled JavaScript file in your Vite project. This can be automated as part of your `yarn build` script.

### 3. Vite Configuration
Adjust your `vite.config.ts` file to explicitly include files from the `shared` directory, though Vite should already be able to import TypeScript files directly. However, adding an alias as suggested previously can help ensure the path is resolved correctly:

```js
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import path from 'path';

export default defineConfig({
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      '/shared/': path.resolve(__dirname, '../shared/'),
    }
  },
});
```

Note: The alias might need adjustment based on your exact directory structure. The `__dirname` in a Vite config might not always behave as expected due to the nature of ES modules, so ensure the path resolves correctly to your `shared` directory.

### 4. Ensure Correct File References
Your project structure and the way files are referenced across different packages or modules can sometimes lead to confusion or misconfiguration. Ensure that every reference to the `shared` directory is consistent and uses the correct path. If your project is large or complex, consider structuring it as a monorepo using tools like Yarn Workspaces or Lerna to simplify dependency management and cross-package imports.

### 5. Debugging Import Resolution
Use console logs or debugging tools to verify that the path resolved by Vite for `shared/endpoints.ts` matches the actual file location. You can temporarily modify the Vite config to log the resolved alias paths:

```js
// vite.config.ts
console.log(path.resolve(__dirname, '../shared/'));
```

### Conclusion
The issue likely revolves around how Vite resolves and handles the import of your `shared/endpoints.ts`. By ensuring the paths are correctly resolved, potentially pre-compiling TypeScript files outside of the Vite's root, and adjusting your Vite configuration to explicitly recognize the `shared` directory, you should be able to address the build error.

If it was a file path error, wouldn't it say "file not found" or something to that effect, rather than ""ENDPOINTS" is not exported by "shared/endpoints.js","?

---

**Codeium** _at 10:19 am, Jun 30, 2024_

You're correct, and I appreciate your patience. If the error were strictly due to a wrong file path, the error message would typically indicate that the file could not be found. Instead, the message you're receiving suggests that Vite's build process does recognize the file but doesn't interpret it as exporting the `ENDPOINTS` constant correctly. Given the error message and the content of `shared/endpoints.ts` you've provided, let's consider a few more nuanced possibilities:

### ES Module Interoperability
Even though your `shared/endpoints.ts` is correctly using named exports, there might be an issue with how Vite or its underlying tools (like Rollup or esbuild) handle ES module interoperability in this context. This could be especially relevant if there's a mix of module types (CommonJS and ES Modules) in your project or dependencies.

### Compilation Output
Since the error references `"shared/endpoints.js"`, it implies that Vite is trying to import from the compiled JavaScript file, not directly from the TypeScript file. Ensure that the TypeScript compilation process (handled outside of Vite for the `shared` directory) correctly outputs the expected ES module format. You can check the compiled `shared/endpoints.js` to confirm it includes the named export as expected.

### TypeScript and JavaScript Module Resolution
TypeScript and JavaScript handle module resolution slightly differently, and Vite's build process could be affected by these differences. Specifically, TypeScript might be handling the module resolution correctly during type-checking, but when Vite tries to bundle or process the code, it might not resolve the module in the same way.

### Cache or Configuration Issues
A misconfiguration in Vite or cache issues could cause outdated or incorrect information to be used during the build process. Clearing Vite's cache and reviewing your Vite and TypeScript configurations for any inconsistencies related to module resolution might help.

### Verify the Compiled Output
It's worth manually checking the compiled `shared/endpoints.js` to ensure it's in the expected format and includes the `export const ENDPOINTS = {...}` statement as expected. If the compiled output is in a different format or wrapped in a way that obscures the export, this could explain the discrepancy.

### Troubleshooting Steps
- **Clear Vite's Cache**: Run `rm -rf node_modules/.vite` and try building again.
- **Check Compiled JavaScript**: Manually inspect `shared/endpoints.js` to ensure it's correctly exporting `ENDPOINTS`.
- **Review Build Configuration**: Ensure that your TypeScript `tsconfig.json` is configured to output ES modules (`"module": "ESNext"` or `"module": "ES6"`).
- **Simplify the Import**: As a test, try simplifying the import to see if the issue persists with a more straightforward setup, potentially in a new file or project.

If none of these steps resolve the issue, consider isolating the problem in a smaller, separate project. This can help determine if the issue is specific to your project's configuration or a more general issue with the tools involved.

**Codeium** _at 10:21 am, Jun 30, 2024_

Given the contents of `shared/endpoints.js`, it's clear that the file is being compiled to use CommonJS module syntax (`exports.ENDPOINTS = ...`). This module format is standard for Node.js but can lead to interoperability issues when used in an ES module context, which is more common in front-end projects and expected by tools like Vite.

The error you're encountering during the build process (`"ENDPOINTS" is not exported by "shared/endpoints.js"`) occurs because Vite, and the plugins it uses for building (such as Rollup or esbuild), expects ES module syntax (e.g., `export const ENDPOINTS = ...`) rather than CommonJS (`exports.ENDPOINTS = ...`).

### Resolving the Module Format Discrepancy

To resolve this issue, you have a couple of options to ensure that `shared/endpoints.js` is compatible with Vite's expectations for ES module imports:

#### Option 1: Convert `shared/endpoints.js` to Use ES Module Syntax

Manually adjust `shared/endpoints.js` to use ES module syntax. This approach requires changing the file to export `ENDPOINTS` using the `export` keyword:

```javascript
// Convert this file to use ES Module syntax
export const ENDPOINTS = {
  // Object structure as before
};
```

This change would make `shared/endpoints.js` directly compatible with Vite's module handling. However, if this file is auto-generated (as it looks to be from a TypeScript compilation process), you'll need to adjust the TypeScript compiler options instead of manually editing the file.

#### Option 2: Adjust TypeScript Compiler Options

Change your `tsconfig.json` file to compile TypeScript to use ES module syntax. You can do this by setting the `"module"` field to `"ESNext"` or `"ES6"`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "ESNext",
    // other options...
  }
}
```

After making this change, recompile your TypeScript code. Ensure that the resulting JavaScript file uses ES module syntax (`export const ENDPOINTS = ...`).

#### Option 3: Importing CommonJS Modules in Vite

If you must keep the CommonJS format for some reason, you can import CommonJS modules in Vite by using dynamic imports, which are more flexible in terms of module format. However, this approach is more of a workaround and might not be suitable for every use case:

```javascript
// Dynamically import the CommonJS module
const endpointsModule = await import('../../shared/endpoints');
const { ENDPOINTS } = endpointsModule;
```

### Additional Consideration

Ensure that your build and development processes are aligned in terms of module formats. Mixing CommonJS and ES modules can lead to complications, especially in projects that target both Node.js and the browser.

After applying one of these solutions, you should be able to resolve the import error and successfully build your project with Vite.

Why was `yarn build` leaving the stale `.js` file in place, rather than overwriting it with the updated syntax?

---

**Codeium** _at 10:25 am, Jun 30, 2024_

The behavior you observed with the stale `.js` file not being overwritten during a build process can result from a few different scenarios in the way your project's build and TypeScript configuration are set up. Here are the most common reasons:

### 1. **Out-of-Sync Build Process**

If the TypeScript compilation step (`tsc`) and the Vite build step (`vite build`) are treated as separate, unrelated steps in your `package.json` scripts, it's possible for TypeScript and Vite to operate on different sets of assumptions about your codebase. For instance, if TypeScript compiles files to a directory that Vite does not clean or manage, then outdated `.js` files might linger between builds.

### 2. **TypeScript Compilation Output Directory**

If your TypeScript configuration (`tsconfig.json`) specifies an `outDir` where compiled JavaScript files are placed, but this directory is not cleaned up as part of your build process, you could end up with stale `.js` files. This is particularly likely if the `outDir` is set to a location outside of Vite's purview (e.g., not within the `src/` directory that Vite watches or not cleared by Vite's build process).

### 3. **Manual Deletion vs. Automated Build Tools**

Automated build tools like Vite typically have features to clean or overwrite old files in their designated output directories (like `dist/` for Vite) but may not manage or clean up TypeScript's output directory unless explicitly configured to do so. If the stale `.js` file was a result of a TypeScript compilation step that was not integrated into Vite's managed build process, Vite would not automatically clean it up.

### 4. **Version Control Systems**

Sometimes, developers might expect build processes to automatically clean up all files, including those tracked by version control systems like git. However, unless explicitly configured, build tools generally do not modify or delete files that are not directly within their output directories.

### Solutions:

- **Integrate TypeScript Compilation with Vite**: Ensure that your build process treats TypeScript compilation as an integral part of the Vite build. Vite itself can handle TypeScript files, converting them to JavaScript as part of its build process without a separate `tsc` step, assuming the project is configured correctly to do so.

- **Use a `prebuild` Script to Clean Up**: Consider adding a `prebuild` script in your `package.json` that cleans your TypeScript output directory before each build:

    ```json
    "scripts": {
      "prebuild": "rimraf ./path/to/compiled/js",
      "build": "tsc && vite build"
    }
    ```

    [`rimraf`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rimraf) is a popular choice for file deletion that works across different operating systems.

- **Review and Adjust `tsconfig.json`**: If you continue to use a separate TypeScript compilation step, ensure that the `outDir` is either integrated into your build process cleanup or located where it doesn't interfere with the rest of your build process.

Understanding the separation of responsibilities between TypeScript's compiler (`tsc`) and Vite, and how they manage files, can help in ensuring that your build processes remain clean and predictable, preventing issues like the one you encountered.

  "./src/types/elements.d.ts",
 ],
 "references": [{ "path": "./tsconfig.node.json" }]
}
```

Currently, all the `.js` files, I think in both projects, seem to be created right next to the source `.ts` files. Is that something I should change?

---

**Codeium** _at 10:29 am, Jun 30, 2024_

Given the details from your `package.json` and `tsconfig.json`, several important points come into focus:

1. **Your Build Script:** The `"build": "tsc && vite build"` script in `package.json` indeed integrates TypeScript compilation with Vite's build process. However, the presence of the `noEmit` option in your `tsconfig.json` effectively prevents `tsc` from emitting `.js` files, which makes the `tsc` command in your build script somewhat redundant. Vite itself handles TypeScript files directly during its build process.

2. **The `noEmit` Option:** The `noEmit` option in your `tsconfig.json` is set to `true`, which instructs TypeScript not to emit output files (like `.js` files) after compilation. This explains why running `tsc` as part of your build process doesn't generate or update `.js` files. This setting is useful for projects that use TypeScript for type-checking but rely on another tool (like Vite) to handle the actual compilation and bundling for the browser.

3. **`.js` Files Next to `.ts` Files:** If you're seeing `.js` files next to your `.ts` files, and your `tsconfig.json` has `"noEmit": true`, those `.js` files are likely remnants from an earlier configuration where `noEmit` was either not set or set to `false`. They could also be generated by an IDE feature or another process not visible in the provided configuration.

### Recommendations:

- **Cleaning Up Stale `.js` Files:** Since Vite is handling your TypeScript compilation for the front end, you can safely delete the `.js` files that are adjacent to your `.ts` files in your project's source directories. To prevent this issue from recurring, ensure that any TypeScript compilation (either through the command line, an IDE, or another process) aligns with your project's intended output configuration.

- **Consider Removing `tsc` from the Build Script:** Because `noEmit` is `true` and Vite handles TypeScript during its build process, you might consider removing `tsc` from your `"build"` script. If the purpose of running `tsc` is for type-checking before the build, consider separating these concerns into different scripts or utilizing Vite plugins that enforce type-checking during the Vite build process.

- **Automate Cleanup as Part of Your Build Process:** To prevent issues related to stale files, you can add a cleanup step to your build process. For instance, if you decide you need to compile `.ts` files to `.js` for any reason and want to keep them separate from the source, you could configure the TypeScript `outDir` option and clean this directory as part of your build process.

- **Adjust TypeScript Configuration if Necessary:** If you have a specific reason for keeping the compiled JavaScript files, consider adjusting your `tsconfig.json` to specify an `outDir` where TypeScript should place emitted files. This can help keep your project organized and ensure that build artifacts are stored separately from source files.

Given your current setup and goals, ensuring that your build and development processes are clean and aligned with your project's structure will help avoid issues related to stale or unexpected files in your codebase.

So I could run something like this to remove the stale `.js` files?

```poweshell
rm src/**/*.js  
```

What is the most common `outDir`? I have:

```json
  "outDir": "./dist",
```

---

**Codeium** _at 10:48 am, Jun 30, 2024_

Yes, you can use a PowerShell command like the one you provided to remove the stale `.js` files. However, the command syntax should be slightly adjusted for PowerShell, especially if you're running on Windows. You can use the `Remove-Item` cmdlet with the `-Recurse` and `-Force` options for a more PowerShell-native approach, which also gives you more control and clarity over what's being deleted:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path src -Recurse -Filter *.js | Remove-Item -Force
```

This command searches recursively for `.js` files starting in the `src` directory and removes them. It's a bit more verbose but clearer and safer, particularly if you're not as familiar with PowerShell's aliases and behavior.

### Common `outDir` Configurations

The `"outDir"` option in `tsconfig.json` specifies where TypeScript places its compiled output (`.js` files, along with other assets like `.d.ts` files if declaration files are being generated). The choice of `outDir` can vary depending on the project's structure, build tools, and deployment strategies. However, some common choices include:

- **`"./dist"`**: This is a very common choice because it clearly separates source code (`src`) from the build output (`dist`), making it easier to deploy or serve the `dist` directory while keeping source files separate. It's used by many tools and frameworks by default.

- **`"./build"`**: Similar to `dist`, `build` is another commonly used directory name for the output of compiled code, particularly in projects created with Create React App or other similar tools.

- **`"./out"`** or **`"./lib"`**: These are often used in library or Node.js projects where the output is intended for consumption by other projects rather than being served directly to end-users.

Given that you mentioned having `"outDir": "./dist"`, it's important to note a couple of things:

- If you're also using Vite, and it outputs its final build artifacts to `./dist`, you might want to avoid any conflicts by having TypeScript output to a different directory, unless TypeScript's output is purely for type-checking or server-side code in a full-stack project. This is particularly relevant because Vite's default behavior is to clean the `dist` directory on build, which could remove TypeScript's output if both are configured to use the same directory.

- If the TypeScript output is intended to be part of your final build (for example, in a Node.js or library project), then having `"outDir": "./dist"` makes sense. Just ensure that your build process and `.gitignore` file are configured to handle this directory appropriately.

Adjusting your `tsconfig.json` and build scripts to align with your project's structure and goals will help ensure a smooth development and build process.
