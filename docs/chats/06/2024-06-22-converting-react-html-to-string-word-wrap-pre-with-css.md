summary: The chat involved a user seeking guidance on how to convert HTML created by rendering a React component into a string to be passed as a response. Codeium recommended using `ReactDOMServer.renderToStaticMarkup` to achieve this. 

In a separate query, the user wanted word-wrap in a `<pre>` element while retaining the monospace font. Codeium suggested using CSS properties `white-space: pre-wrap`, `word-break: break-word`, and `font-family: monospace` to achieve the desired effect without needing to change the element to a `<div>`.

I want to pass some HTML created by rendering a component, but I think I need to pass it as a string.

Is there any way I can do that?

```tsx
  if(command === 'help'){
   status = 200;
   const commandChords = "help".split('').map(c => {
    return <ChordDisplay displayChar={c} displayCharCode={c} />
   });  
   console.log(commandChords);
   response = "Commands:\n" + commandChords.join(''); 
  }
```

To pass HTML created by rendering a React component as a string, you can use `ReactDOMServer.renderToStaticMarkup` from the `react-dom/server` package. This method generates HTML content as a string from your React elements.

Here's how you can update your code to convert the `commandChords` array of React elements into an HTML string:

```tsx
import ReactDOMServer from 'react-dom/server';

// ...

if (command === 'help') {
  status = 200;
  const commandChords = "help".split('').map(c => {
    return <ChordDisplay displayChar={c} displayCharCode={c} />
  });
  // Convert the array of React elements to an HTML string
  const commandChordsHtml = commandChords.map(ReactDOMServer.renderToStaticMarkup).join('');
  response = "Commands:\n" + commandChordsHtml;
}
```

This will render each `ChordDisplay` component to a static HTML string, concatenate them without commas (since `.join('')` is used), and assign the result to the `response` variable as a string of HTML.

I have a `<pre>` component in here:

```html
<div class="tutorial-component"><pre>The most important key is the Return (ENTER) key. Press the thumb tip and release.</pre><div class="chord-display-container"><div class="chord-image-holder" id="chord-image-holder" data-source="ErrorDisplay.tsx"><div class="col-sm-2 row generated next" id="chord2"><span id="char15" class="char">Return</span><img loading="lazy" alt="2" src="/images/svgs/0.svg" width="75" class="hand"></div></div></div></div>
```

But it is not flowing with word-wrap in my TUI app. I would like it to flow like regular text, but with the monospace font.

Should I just change it to a `<div>` and format the div to monospace? I know that `<pre>` means preformatted and might preclude word wrap.

To enable word-wrap in a `<pre>` element while keeping the monospace font, you can use the CSS property `white-space`. The `pre-wrap` value for this property will maintain whitespace formatting but also wrap text as needed. Here's how you can apply it to your `.tutorial-component pre`:

```css
.tutorial-component pre {
    white-space: pre-wrap; /* Allows text to wrap */
    word-break: break-word; /* Ensures words break to prevent overflow */
    font-family: monospace; /* Maintains monospace font */
}
```

There's no need to change the `<pre>` element to a `<div>`; simply adding these styles will enable word-wrapping while preserving whitespace and monospace styling.
