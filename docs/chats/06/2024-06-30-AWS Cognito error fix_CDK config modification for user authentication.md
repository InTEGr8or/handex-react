summary: The user encountered an error when trying to log in to AWS Cognito, specifically related to the `USER_PASSWORD_AUTH` flow not being enabled for the Cognito User Pool Client. They shared code for a Lambda function handling the sign-in process and requested assistance on enabling this flow.

I helped them understand the error and provided guidance on enabling the `USER_PASSWORD_AUTH` flow using the AWS CLI. The user then expressed a preference to modify the CDK configuration instead of using the command line for this task.

I guided them on modifying the CDK code to enable the `USER_PASSWORD_AUTH` flow and allow users to sign in using only their email and password. The user also inquired about security implications of allowing password-based logins and AWS tools or best practices to enhance security in such scenarios.

I provided information on security measures like SSL/TLS encryption, client-side hashing, and multi-factor authentication to enhance the security of user authentication in AWS Cognito.

The error you're encountering, `InvalidParameterException: USER_PASSWORD_AUTH flow not included for this client`, suggests that the USER_PASSWORD_AUTH authentication flow is not enabled for the Cognito User Pool Client you're trying to use.

In AWS Cognito, the `USER_PASSWORD_AUTH` authentication flow allows users to authenticate directly with their username and password. This flow needs to be explicitly enabled on the User Pool Client settings.

To resolve this issue, you will need to enable `USER_PASSWORD_AUTH` for your Cognito User Pool Client. You can do this in the AWS Management Console or through the AWS CLI. Since you prefer PowerShell, I'll guide you on how to do this using the AWS CLI, which you can run in PowerShell:

1. **First, check the current settings of your User Pool Client to confirm `USER_PASSWORD_AUTH` is not enabled:**
```powershell
aws cognito-idp describe-user-pool-client --user-pool-id your_user_pool_id --client-id your_client_id --region us-east-1
```
Replace `your_user_pool_id` with your Cognito User Pool ID and `your_client_id` with your Cognito User Pool Client ID.

2. **Enable `USER_PASSWORD_AUTH` using the `update-user-pool-client` command:**
```powershell
aws cognito-idp update-user-pool-client --user-pool-id your_user_pool_id --client-id your_client_id --explicit-auth-flows ALLOW_USER_SRP_AUTH,ALLOW_REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH,ALLOW_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH --region us-east-1
```
This command adds `ALLOW_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH` to the list of `ExplicitAuthFlows` for your User Pool Client, enabling the `USER_PASSWORD_AUTH` flow.

After running this command, try your login operation again.

If you're not familiar with the AWS CLI or if it's not configured, you might need to install it and configure it with your AWS credentials first. The AWS CLI provides a consistent way to manage AWS services directly from your terminal or PowerShell prompt.

Rather than making ad hoc modifications from the command line, I would prefer to modify the configuration-as-code module I have set up in the `cdk/`.

To modify your Cognito User Pool Client configuration in your CDK code to enable the `USER_PASSWORD_AUTH` flow and allow users to sign in using only their email and password, you will need to adjust the `addClient` method call parameters for your `UserPool`.

Here are the modifications you will need to make:

1. **Enable `USER_PASSWORD_AUTH` flow:**
   Inside the `userPool.addClient` method, add `userPassword: true` to the `authFlows` property. This enables the password-based authentication for your client.

2. **Use Email as Username:**
   You've already configured `signInAliases` with `email: true`, which allows users to sign in using their email. This configuration treats the email as a username alias, effectively allowing users to use their email as the username.

Here's the updated section of your code with these changes:

```typescript
// Inside the HandTermCdkStack class

// Cognito User Pool
const userPool = new cognito.UserPool(this, 'HandTermUserPool', {
  userPoolName: 'HandTermUserPool',
  selfSignUpEnabled: true,
  userVerification: {
    emailSubject: 'Verify your email for our app!',
    emailBody: 'Hello {username}, Thanks for signing up to our app! Your verification code is {####}',
    emailStyle: cognito.VerificationEmailStyle.CODE,
  },
  signInAliases: {
    email: true // Allow users to sign in using their email
  },
  passwordPolicy: {
    minLength: 8,
    requireUppercase: true,
    requireLowercase: true,
    requireDigits: true,
    requireSymbols: true,
  },
  autoVerify: { email: true }
});

// Cognito User Pool Client
const userPoolClient = userPool.addClient('AppClient', {
  authFlows: {
    userSrp: true,
    userPassword: true // Enable USER_PASSWORD_AUTH flow
  },
  generateSecret: false,
  // Additional configurations as needed
});
```

With these changes, your Cognito User Pool Client will now allow the `USER_PASSWORD_AUTH` flow, enabling users to authenticate with a username (in this case, their email) and password directly. Also, since you've configured the `signInAliases` with `email: true`, users can use their email addresses as their usernames.

Make sure to deploy these changes using your preferred CDK deployment command, such as `cdk deploy`, to apply these configurations to your AWS environment.

So, logging in with the password might have some security implications.

That's probably why they make you explicitly allow it.

Does AWS provide any tools to mitigate any of these concerns, such as client-side encryption of the password or login credentials, or anything like that? Or do they provide any guidance for people who do decide to do something so insecure as to allow their users to log in with just the typed in password?

---

**Codeium** _at 5:24 pm, Jun 30, 2024_

AWS provides several mechanisms and best practices to enhance the security of user authentication, including when allowing users to log in with just a username (or email) and password. While AWS Cognito itself handles the secure storage and verification of user credentials, there are additional measures you can take to secure the login process:

1. **SSL/TLS Encryption:**
   Ensure that all communications between your client application and AWS services (including Cognito) are transmitted over HTTPS. This encrypts the data in transit, protecting it from being intercepted. AWS Cognito endpoints are HTTPS-enabled by default.

2. **Client-Side Hashing:**
   Although AWS Cognito securely hashes passwords server-side, you might consider additional client-side hashing as an extra security measure. However, this is not a common practice because it can complicate the security model without significantly enhancing security if SSL/TLS is already in use. AWS does not provide built-in client-side hashing tools in Cognito because the passwords need to be sent to the server in plain text for Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol, which Cognito uses for secure password verification.

3. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
   Enabling MFA adds an additional layer of security. With MFA, after entering their username and password, users are required to provide another piece of information only they should have access to, such as a code from an SMS message or an authentication app. Cognito supports MFA and makes it relatively straightforward to implement.

4. **Advanced Security Features:**
   AWS Cognito offers advanced security features (as part of the user pool options) that help protect your users. These features include anomaly detection, which can identify and block unusual sign-in attempts, and adaptive authentication, which can prompt users for additional verification when unusual sign-in activity is detected.

5. **Regularly Update Security Settings:**
   AWS regularly updates its services with new security features and recommendations. Stay informed about these updates and apply recommended security settings and practices to your user pool and other AWS resources.

6. **Security Audits and Analysis:**
   Utilize AWS services like AWS CloudTrail and Amazon CloudWatch to monitor and log security events. Regular audits can help you identify and mitigate potential security risks.

7. **Client-Side Validation:**
   Implement client-side checks to ensure that users create strong passwords, according to the policies you've set in Cognito. While Cognito enforces password policies, client-side validation can provide immediate feedback to users, improving the user experience.

8. **Education and Awareness:**
   Educate your users about the importance of using strong, unique passwords and securing their authentication credentials. User education is a critical component of application security.

While AWS provides the tools and services to build secure applications, the responsibility to configure these tools correctly and follow best practices lies with you, the developer. Ensure you're familiar with the AWS Well-Architected Framework, particularly the Security Pillar, for guidance on designing and operating secure applications and workloads in the cloud.

**User** _at 8:18 pm, Jun 30, 2024_

I have to get the logged in user's username.

When I log in, I get an `AccessToken`, `ExpiresIn`, `"TokenType": "Bearer"`, `RefreshToken`, and `IdToken`, but I have not done anything to store them.

---

**Codeium** _at 8:19 pm, Jun 30, 2024_

To obtain the logged-in user's username after they've logged in using AWS Cognito, you can decode the `IdToken` you receive upon authentication. The `IdToken` is a JSON Web Token (JWT) that contains claims about the authenticated user, including their username and other attributes.

### Steps to Handle and Decode the `IdToken`:

1. **Store Tokens Securely**: After a successful login, store the `AccessToken`, `IdToken`, and `RefreshToken` securely. In a web application, you should store these tokens in a secure, HttpOnly cookie to prevent access from JavaScript and reduce the risk of XSS attacks. As you've mentioned not having stored them, you'll need to implement this storage mechanism.

    In your AWS Lambda function that handles the login, you can set the tokens in cookies like this:

    ```typescript
    const response = {
        statusCode: 200,
        headers: {
            'Set-Cookie': `AccessToken=${data.AuthenticationResult.AccessToken}; Secure; HttpOnly; Path=/`,
            'Set-Cookie': `IdToken=${data.AuthenticationResult.IdToken}; Secure; HttpOnly; Path=/`,
            'Set-Cookie': `RefreshToken=${data.AuthenticationResult.RefreshToken}; Secure; HttpOnly; Path=/`,
            // Additional headers...
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            message: 'Authentication successful',
            // Any other response payload
        }),
    };
    return response;
    ```

2. **Decode the `IdToken` on the Server-Side**: When you need to retrieve the username or other user attributes, you can decode the `IdToken` on the server-side. The `IdToken` is a JWT, so you can decode it to access the claims. Here's an example of how you could do it in a TypeScript AWS Lambda function:

    ```typescript
    import { decode } from 'jsonwebtoken'; // Use jsonwebtoken package
    
    exports.handler = async (event) => {
        const idToken = event.headers['IdToken']; // Assuming the token is sent in the headers
        const decodedToken = decode(idToken);
        if (decodedToken && typeof decodedToken === 'object') {
            const username = decodedToken['cognito:username']; // 'cognito:username' holds the username
            // Use username as needed
        }
    };
    ```

    Note: This example uses the `jsonwebtoken` npm package, which you can include in your Lambda deployment package or Lambda layer. Decoding in this manner does not verify the signature of the JWT. For most cases where the token is obtained directly from Cognito in a secure manner, this might be acceptable. However, for full verification, you would need to use a library capable of verifying the token signature against the public keys provided by Cognito.

3. **Client-Side Decoding**: If you're handling tokens on the client side (e.g., in a web app), you can decode the `IdToken` client-side to access the username. This can be useful for client-side logic, such as customizing UI elements to display the user's name. However, sensitive operations should rely on server-side validation of the token.

    ```javascript
    const idToken = 'YOUR_ID_TOKEN_HERE';
    const decodedToken = JSON.parse(atob(idToken.split('.')[1]));
    const username = decodedToken['cognito:username'];
    ```

Remember, while decoding the `IdToken` can provide you with the username and other attributes, you should validate the token's signature server-side before trusting its content for critical operations. The AWS SDK and libraries like `jsonwebtoken` in Node.js can help with decoding and validating tokens.

**User** _at 8:52 pm, Jun 30, 2024_

I definitely want to implement the HttpOnly Cookie strategy, but when I try to set the headers like you describe above I get:

```
An object literal cannot have multiple properties with the same name.ts(1117)
```

That's on the multiple rows of `Set-Cookie`.

I have been planning on using this:

```ts
// cdk/lambda/tokenHandler/tokenHandler.ts

exports.handler = async (event: { queryStringParameters: any; }) => {
  // Extract query string parameters from the event
  const queryParams = event.queryStringParameters;
   
  // Example for Authorization Code Grant
  const code = queryParams.code;

  // Example for Implicit Grant
  const idToken = queryParams.id_token;
  const accessToken = queryParams.access_token;
  const refreshToken = queryParams.refresh_token;

  // Your logic here to handle the tokens or code

  // Example response to set cookies and redirect
  const response = {
    statusCode: 302,
    headers: {
      'Set-Cookie': `idToken=${idToken}; Secure; HttpOnly; Path=/`,
      'Location': 'https://handterm.com'
    },
    body: ''
  };
  return response;
};
```

but I don't know how to integrate that with what you described above.

Is my `tokenHandler` supposed to look more like your token decoder you described above?

---

**Codeium** _at 8:53 pm, Jun 30, 2024_

The TypeScript error you're encountering is due to trying to set multiple `Set-Cookie` headers directly in an object literal, which does not allow duplicate keys. To set multiple cookies in a response from an AWS Lambda function (such as in an API Gateway or Lambda@Edge context), you'll need to concatenate them into a single `Set-Cookie` header string or use an array if the framework supports it.

For API Gateway, the way to set multiple cookies in the HTTP response is to use a multi-value header. Unfortunately, as of my last update, API Gateway's standard Lambda integration does not natively support multi-value headers for `Set-Cookie` in the Lambda response to API Gateway. However, the HTTP API Gateway (not REST API) does support them. If you're using REST API, you typically work around this by encoding multiple `Set-Cookie` values into a single string, but this is not standard and might not be correctly interpreted by all clients.

Given this, for your scenario where you're using a Lambda function like `tokenHandler`, you would generally handle the tokens server-side and set the cookies in a response that is properly interpreted by the client (browser). If you're using HTTP API Gateway, you can leverage the built-in support for multi-value headers.

### Solution for HTTP API Gateway

If you're using HTTP API, you can set multiple cookies like this:

```typescript
// Example response to set cookies and redirect
const response = {
    statusCode: 302,
    headers: {
        'Location': 'https://handterm.com'
    },
    multiValueHeaders: {
        'Set-Cookie': [
            `idToken=${idToken}; Secure; HttpOnly; Path=/`,
            `accessToken=${accessToken}; Secure; HttpOnly; Path=/`,
            `refreshToken=${refreshToken}; Secure; HttpOneWay; Path=/`
        ]
    },
    body: ''
};
return response;
```

### Workaround for REST API Gateway

For REST API where you cannot use `multiValueHeaders`, you would typically need to set a single `Set-Cookie` header with all cookies concatenated, separated by commas. However, this approach has compatibility issues with some clients and is not recommended.

### Direct Lambda Response

If your Lambda function is invoked directly (e.g., through Lambda Invoke API) and not via API Gateway, you have full control over the response format, but you need to ensure the client (e.g., a server or another Lambda function) that processes this response can correctly handle and interpret the `Set-Cookie` header format you choose.

### Regarding Token Handling

The example I provided for decoding the `IdToken` is primarily for server-side token validation or client-side use where you need to extract user information from the token. Your `tokenHandler` Lambda function, as it stands, is focused on the redirection and setting cookies part after handling tokens.

In your case, since you're dealing with cookies and potentially sensitive tokens, make sure that any token handling, redirecting, and cookie setting is done securely and in accordance with best practices, including using HTTPS and setting appropriate cookie attributes (`Secure`, `HttpOnly`, and potentially `SameSite`).

If your architecture involves API Gateway and you need to set multiple cookies in responses frequently, consider using HTTP API for its native multi-value header support, which simplifies setting multiple cookies correctly.

I am trying to do this in `signIn.ts`. I think that is what you're suggesting, right?

```ts
  const { username, password } = body;
  // Ensure ClientId is a string and not undefined
  const clientId = process.env.COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_ID;
  if (!clientId) {
   throw new Error('COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_ID environment variable is not set.');
  }
  const params = {
   AuthFlow: 'USER_PASSWORD_AUTH',
   ClientId: clientId,
   AuthParameters: {
    USERNAME: username,
    PASSWORD: password,
   },
  };
  body.params = params;
  const data = await cognito.initiateAuth(params).promise();

  console.log('SignIn success:', JSON.stringify(data));
  const { idToken, accessToken, refreshToken } = data.AuthenticationResult;
  return {
   statusCode: 200,
   headers: {
    "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
    "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials": true,
   },
   multiValueHeaders: {
    'Set-Cookie': [
     `idToken=${idToken}; Secure; HttpOnly; Path=/`,
     `accessToken=${accessToken}; Secure; HttpOnly; Path=/`,
     `refreshToken=${refreshToken}; Secure; HttpOneWay; Path=/`
    ]
   },
   body: JSON.stringify(data.AuthenticationResult),
  };
```

But it says "Property 'idToken' does not exist on type 'AuthenticationResultType | undefined'.ts(2339)"

I guess I am using `RestApi`

This is in my `cdk/lib/cdk-stack.ts`

```ts
  const api = new apigateway.RestApi(this, 'HandTermApi', {
   restApiName: 'HandTermService',
   description: 'This service serves authentication requests.',
   // Add default CORS options here
   defaultCorsPreflightOptions: corsConfig,
  });

  // Assuming `api` is your RestApi object and `userPool` is your Cognito User Pool
  const cognitoAuthorizer = new apigateway.CognitoUserPoolsAuthorizer(this, 'CognitoAuthorizer', {
   cognitoUserPools: [userPool],
   identitySource: 'method.request.header.Authorization',
   authorizerName: 'CognitoAuthorizer'
  });
```

Given that you're using AWS API Gateway's `RestApi` and encountering the issue with TypeScript not recognizing the properties of `AuthenticationResultType`, it seems like the problem stems from TypeScript's strict type checking. The `AuthenticationResultType` from AWS SDK for JavaScript does indeed have `IdToken`, `AccessToken`, and `RefreshToken`, but they are optional properties, hence they might be `undefined`.

### Resolving TypeScript Error

To address the TypeScript error, you can use optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`) operators when accessing these properties. This approach makes your code more robust by handling cases where these properties might be missing:

```typescript
const { IdToken, AccessToken, RefreshToken } = data.AuthenticationResult ?? {};

if (!IdToken || !AccessToken || !RefreshToken) {
  // Handle the missing tokens scenario, perhaps by throwing an error or returning an error response
  return {
    statusCode: 400,
    body: JSON.stringify({ message: "Authentication failed or incomplete." }),
  };
}

// Proceed with setting the tokens in cookies
```

### Setting Multiple Cookies in REST API

For setting multiple cookies in a response when using AWS API Gateway's `RestApi`, you'll need to consolidate them into a single `Set-Cookie` header due to the limitations mentioned earlier. Here's an approach that works around the limitation by concatenating cookie strings:

```typescript
// Concatenate the Set-Cookie strings into a single header value
const setCookieHeader = [
  `idToken=${IdToken}; Secure; HttpOnly; Path=/`,
  `accessToken=${AccessToken}; Secure; HttpOnly; Path=/`,
  `refreshToken=${RefreshToken}; Secure; HttpOnly; Path=/`
].join(', ');

return {
  statusCode: 200,
  headers: {
    "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
    "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials": true,
    "Set-Cookie": setCookieHeader
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(data.AuthenticationResult),
};
```

However, do note that while this approach can work, it's not the most reliable due to how different browsers might parse multiple cookies in a single `Set-Cookie` header. The most compatible way to set multiple cookies in a response via API Gateway's `RestApi` is through the HTTP API or by using a workaround that fits within the confines of the REST API's limitations, such as handling cookie setting client-side or using a different flow that doesn't require setting multiple cookies in one response.

### Client-Side Handling

Considering the limitations and to ensure maximum compatibility across browsers, you might want to handle the token storage client-side. For example, after receiving tokens, you can store them in the browser's storage mechanisms (preferably HttpOnly cookies for tokens, but this requires server-side setting). As an alternative, consider securely transmitting tokens to the client and then using JavaScript to manage storage, keeping in mind security implications and best practices.

Would the situation be improved by converting my Rest API to a HTTP API Gateway?

---

**Codeium** _at 9:15 pm, Jun 30, 2024_

Yes, converting your REST API to an HTTP API in API Gateway could improve the situation regarding multiple `Set-Cookie` headers for several reasons:

1. **Native Support for Multi-Value Headers:** HTTP APIs support multi-value headers natively, including multiple `Set-Cookie` headers. This means you can set multiple cookies in a response without needing to concatenate them into a single header string, improving compatibility with various clients and browsers.

2. **Simplified and More Efficient API:** HTTP APIs are designed to be faster and more cost-effective than REST APIs for most use cases. They offer built-in features like JWT authorizer support, which can simplify token handling and authorization in your applications.

3. **Reduced Latency and Cost:** HTTP APIs have lower latency and are generally cheaper than REST APIs. If your application is sensitive to latency or you're looking for a more cost-effective solution, migrating to HTTP APIs could be beneficial.

4. **Ease of Use:** With HTTP APIs, the configuration and deployment process is streamlined, offering a more straightforward approach to API management. This could simplify managing authentication flows and setting response headers, including cookies.

### Steps to Migrate from REST API to HTTP API:

- **Evaluate Features:** Ensure that all the features you use in REST API are available and compatible with HTTP API. While HTTP APIs cover many common use cases, there may be specific REST API features (e.g., certain integrations and request/response transformations) not yet supported by HTTP APIs.
  
- **Create a New HTTP API:** Using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs, create a new HTTP API. Configure it according to your needs, setting up routes, integrations, and authorizers as required.

- **Update Lambda Functions:** Modify your Lambda function responses to use multi-value headers for setting multiple `Set-Cookie` headers. With HTTP API, you can return a structure like this from your Lambda function:

    ```typescript
    return {
      statusCode: 200,
      headers: {
        "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
        "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials": "true",
      },
      multiValueHeaders: {
        "Set-Cookie": [
          `idToken=${IdToken}; Secure; HttpOnly; Path=/;`,
          `accessToken=${AccessToken}; Secure; HttpOnly; Path=/;`,
          `refreshToken=${RefreshToken}; Secure; HttpOnly; Path=/;`
        ]
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ message: "Success" }),
    };
    ```

- **Test the New Setup:** Thoroughly test your HTTP API to ensure that it behaves as expected, especially focusing on authentication flows, token handling, and cookie settings.

- **Update DNS and Client Applications:** Once you're confident in the new HTTP API's functionality and performance, update your DNS settings (if using custom domains) and any client applications to use the new HTTP API endpoint.

Migration can be a significant change, especially for existing applications with users. Therefore, it's essential to plan, test thoroughly, and perhaps gradually transition traffic to the new API to minimize disruptions.

I am not going to make any changes in the AWS Management Console. I have a `cdk-stack.ts` that I posted above and I will be using that to make changes, unless there is some specific reason you're suggesting the AWS console.

I am the only current user of the application, so now is the time to make the change, if it's appropriate.

The CDK creates Cognito features, the API, an S3 bucket that I'll use to store string data, and attackes several Lambda functions to the API. 

How should I modify it to use an HTTP API?

---

**Codeium** _at 10:08 pm, Jun 30, 2024_

Given your scenario and your preference to manage infrastructure as code using AWS CDK, converting your REST API to an HTTP API within your `cdk-stack.ts` is indeed the right approach. Below, I'll guide you through updating your CDK stack to use an HTTP API instead of a REST API for managing your authentication flows and other functionalities.

### Step 1: Install Necessary CDK Packages

Make sure you have the latest version of AWS CDK installed and update or add the necessary CDK library for HTTP APIs. If you're using npm, run:

```sh
npm install @aws-cdk/aws-apigatewayv2 @aws-cdk/aws-apigatewayv2-integrations
```

These packages include the constructs for HTTP APIs and their integrations, respectively.

### Step 2: Update Your CDK Stack to Use HTTP API

In your `cdk-stack.ts`, replace the REST API parts with HTTP API constructs. Here's how you can do it, based on the code snippets you've provided:

1. **Import HTTP API Constructs**

First, modify your import statements to include HTTP API constructs:

```typescript
import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import { HttpApi, HttpMethod } from '@aws-cdk/aws-apigatewayv2';
import { LambdaProxyIntegration } from '@aws-cdk/aws-apigatewayv2-integrations';
// Import other necessary constructs
```

2. **Replace the REST API with an HTTP API**

Then, replace the REST API definition with an HTTP API in your stack. Here's a simplified version based on your existing setup:

```typescript
export class HandTermCdkStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    // Define the HTTP API
    const httpApi = new HttpApi(this, 'HandTermApi', {
      apiName: 'HandTermService',
      description: 'This service serves authentication requests.',
      // CORS configuration if needed
      corsPreflight: {
        allowOrigins: ['*'],
        allowMethods: [HttpMethod.GET, HttpMethod.POST, HttpMethod.OPTIONS],
        allowHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization'],
      },
    });

    // Define Lambda functions and integrate them with the HTTP API as needed
    // Example for a signIn function
    const signInLambda = new lambda.Function(this, 'SignInFunction', {
      runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_16_X,
      handler: 'signIn.handler',
      code: lambda.Code.fromAsset('lambda/authentication'),
      environment: {
        COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_ID: 'yourCognitoAppClientId',
      },
    });
    
    const signInIntegration = new LambdaProxyIntegration({
      handler: signInLambda,
    });

    httpApi.addRoutes({
      path: '/signin',
      methods: [HttpMethod.POST],
      integration: signInIntegration,
    });

    // Similarly, add other routes and integrations as needed

    // Outputs
    new cdk.CfnOutput(this, 'HttpApiUrl', { value: httpApi.url });
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Deploy Your Changes

After updating your CDK stack, deploy your changes using the AWS CDK CLI:

```sh
cdk deploy
```

This command will update your CloudFormation stack with the new HTTP API and its configurations.

### Additional Consideration

Since you are the only current user and actively developing, making such a change now is appropriate. HTTP APIs provide not only a simpler and more cost-effective way to handle API requests but also better support for common use cases like yours, including easier management of `Set-Cookie` headers for authentication flows.

Remember, after deploying changes, you may need to update the endpoints in your client application(s) to point to the new HTTP API endpoint.

**User** _at 7:32 am, Jul 1, 2024_

I am getting this error: `Module '"aws-cdk-lib/aws-apigatewayv2-integrations"' has no exported member 'LambdaProxyIntegration'.ts(2305)`

---

**Codeium** _at 7:32 am, Jul 1, 2024_

The error message you're encountering suggests there's a problem with the import statement for `LambdaProxyIntegration` from the `@aws-cdk/aws-apigatewayv2-integrations` module. This could be due to a few reasons, such as changes in the AWS CDK library or a typo in the import. 

As of my last update, the correct construct for integrating a Lambda function with an HTTP API in the AWS CDK is `HttpLambdaIntegration` from the `@aws-cdk/aws-apigatewayv2-integrations` package, not `LambdaProxyIntegration`. This might have caused the confusion.

Let's correct the import and usage according to the latest AWS CDK version available at the time of writing:

### Step 1: Correct the Import

First, ensure you're importing `HttpLambdaIntegration` from the correct package:

```typescript
import { HttpLambdaIntegration } from '@aws-cdk/aws-apigatewayv2-integrations';
```

### Step 2: Update the Integration in Your Stack

Next, update the part of your stack where you're setting up the integration with your Lambda function. Use `HttpLambdaIntegration` instead of `LambdaProxyIntegration`:

```typescript
import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import { HttpApi, HttpMethod } from '@aws-cdk/aws-apigatewayv2';
import { HttpLambdaIntegration } from '@aws-cdk/aws-apigatewayv2-integrations';
import * as lambda from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda';

export class HandTermCdkStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    // Define the HTTP API
    const httpApi = new HttpApi(this, 'HandTermApi', {
      apiName: 'HandTermService',
      description: 'This service serves authentication requests.',
      // CORS configuration if needed
      corsPreflight: {
        allowOrigins: ['*'],
        allowMethods: [HttpMethod.GET, HttpMethod.POST, HttpMethod.OPTIONS],
        allowHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization'],
      },
    });

    // Example Lambda function for signIn
    const signInLambda = new lambda.Function(this, 'SignInFunction', {
      runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_16_X,
      handler: 'signIn.handler',
      code: lambda.Code.fromAsset('lambda/authentication'),
      environment: {
        // Your environment variables
      },
    });

    // Integration with the HTTP API
    const signInIntegration = new HttpLambdaIntegration('SignInIntegration', signInLambda);

    httpApi.addRoutes({
      path: '/signin',
      methods: [HttpMethod.POST],
      integration: signInIntegration,
    });

    // Output the HTTP API URL
    new cdk.CfnOutput(this, 'HttpApiUrl', { value: httpApi.url });
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Verify Package Versions

Ensure your AWS CDK packages (`aws-cdk-lib`, `@aws-cdk/aws-apigatewayv2`, `@aws-cdk/aws-apigatewayv2-integrations`) are up-to-date. The AWS CDK evolves rapidly, and API changes can occur. Run `npm update` to update your packages to the latest versions.

```sh
npm update
```

### Step 4: Deploy the Changes

After making these corrections, deploy your stack again with the AWS CDK CLI:

```sh
cdk deploy
```

This should resolve the import error and successfully deploy your HTTP API with Lambda integrations.

The error you're encountering suggests there's a conflict between types or versions of the AWS CDK libraries you're using in your project. This can happen if there are mixed imports from `aws-cdk-lib` and the individual service packages like `@aws-cdk/aws-lambda` or `@aws-cdk/aws-iam`. Since the AWS CDK v2, the recommended practice is to use `aws-cdk-lib` for all AWS service constructs and avoid importing from individual service packages.

### Resolving the Issue

1. **Ensure Consistent Imports**: Make sure all your CDK construct imports come from `aws-cdk-lib` rather than individual service packages. This means replacing any imports from `@aws-cdk/aws-something` with their equivalents from `aws-cdk-lib`.

2. **Update Your Import Statements**: For your `HttpLambdaIntegration` and any other AWS service constructs, ensure you're using `aws-cdk-lib`. The integration should also come from `aws-cdk-lib` or its compatible integration package, which, as of CDK v2, should be part of `aws-cdk-lib` or a compatible separate package that aligns with CDK v2.

3. **Verify Your `package.json`**: Check your `package.json` file to ensure you're not mixing CDK v1 and v2 dependencies. You should only have `aws-cdk-lib` and possibly `constructs` listed under dependencies for CDK-related items. If you find any `@aws-cdk/aws-xxx` entries, consider removing them and replacing their usage in your codebase with imports from `aws-cdk-lib`.

4. **Correct the Integration Import**: If you're using CDK v2, the import for `HttpLambdaIntegration` should come from the correct library. As of my last update, `HttpLambdaIntegration` was part of the `@aws-cdk/aws-apigatewayv2-integrations` package for version 1 of the CDK. For CDK v2, ensure you have the correct and updated integration package that is compatible with `aws-cdk-lib`. If there's no direct `HttpLambdaIntegration` in `aws-cdk-lib`, you might need to use an updated package specifically designed for HTTP API integrations in CDK v2.

Given these considerations, your import statements should look something like this:

```typescript
import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import { HttpApi, HttpMethod } from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-apigatewayv2';
// Import the correct integration construct for your version
import { HttpLambdaIntegration } from 'PATH-TO-CORRECT-INTEGRATION-CONSTRUCT';
import * as lambda from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda';
```

It's also worth running `npm list` to check for any nested dependencies that might be causing version conflicts or duplicates in your `node_modules` directory.

If after these steps you're still facing issues, consider checking the specific documentation for the version of the AWS CDK you're using, as there might have been changes or updates.

      integration: new HttpLambdaIntegration(
        'get-todos-integration',
        getTodosLambda,
      ),
    });
```

I'am going to give that a shot.

**Codeium** _at 8:13 am, Jul 1, 2024_

It looks like there might be some confusion due to the mix of imports from `aws-cdk-lib` and `@aws-cdk/aws-apigatewayv2-integrations`. To clarify, when using AWS CDK v2 (which is indicated by the use of `aws-cdk-lib`), you should indeed try to stick with imports from `aws-cdk-lib` for consistency and to avoid potential conflicts or compatibility issues.

### Correcting the Import for HTTP API Integrations

Given your imports and the structure you're aiming for, it seems there was a misunderstanding regarding the integration construct from my previous advice. If you're using CDK v2, the integration classes for HTTP API would typically also be imported from `aws-cdk-lib` or a compatible package that aligns with CDK v2. However, as of my last update, the integration with Lambda for HTTP APIs in CDK v2 might require using a separate package due to the way CDK is structured.

Given that, your attempt to use `HttpLambdaIntegration` from `@aws-cdk/aws-apigatewayv2-integrations` is correct if you're following documentation or examples that specifically use this package. This package is indeed separate from `aws-cdk-lib` and is used for advanced API Gateway integrations scenarios, including with HTTP APIs.

### Ensuring Compatibility and Latest Versions

1. **Ensure You Have the Correct Package Installed**: If you haven't already, make sure to install `@aws-cdk/aws-apigatewayv2-integrations` with the version that's compatible with your CDK v2 setup. Use npm or yarn to add it to your project:

    ```sh
    npm install @aws-cdk/aws-apigatewayv2-integrations
    # or, if using yarn
    yarn add @aws-cdk/aws-apigatewayv2-integrations
    ```

2. **Review and Update Your Code as Needed**: Based on the snippet you're planning to try, the approach seems aligned with CDK v2 practices for setting up an HTTP API integration with a Lambda function. Make sure that all parts of your code, especially those related to AWS CDK constructs, are consistently using the v2 naming conventions and imports from `aws-cdk-lib`, except for those explicitly meant to be from separate packages like `@aws-cdk/aws-apigatewayv2-integrations`.

### Example Code Snippet Adjustment

Your adjusted code snippet looks correct; just ensure you've installed the `@aws-cdk/aws-apigatewayv2-integrations` package as mentioned above:

```typescript
import { HttpMethod, HttpApi } from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-apigatewayv2';
import { HttpLambdaIntegration } from '@aws-cdk/aws-apigatewayv2-integrations';
import * as lambda from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda';
// Other imports as needed...

const getTodosLambda = new lambda.Function(this, 'get-todos', {
  runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_18_X,
  handler: 'index.main',
  code: lambda.Code.fromAsset(path.join(__dirname, '/../src/get-todos')),
});

// Add route for GET /todos
httpApi.addRoutes({
  path: '/todos',
  methods: [HttpMethod.GET],
  integration: new HttpLambdaIntegration('get-todos-integration', getTodosLambda),
});
```

This is consistent with best practices for setting up HTTP APIs in AWS CDK v2. The key is ensuring that all necessary packages are installed and correctly referenced in your code. If you run into any further issues, it might be helpful to check the AWS CDK documentation for the latest guidance on integrating Lambda functions with HTTP APIs, as the AWS CDK is frequently updated.
