I am changing this app from using `amazon-cognito-identity-js` to using a Lambda@Edge function to provide more secure authentication and access to per-user S3 bucket paths.

This is my current CloudFormatoin stack template, but I am moving the deployment to AWS SAM and I think it might be possible to do all the configuration in there.

I have the latest sam-cli and I ran `sam init` with the `hello-world` template, although I am not sure that is the best template so I could start over with `sam init`

I have updated this `useAuth.ts` partially, in order to work with the Lambda@Edge function, but I think I still need to do more work on it:

```ts
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

const API_BASE_URL = 'https://your-api-gateway-url';

export const useAuth = () => {
 const [isLoggedIn, setIsLoggedIn] = useState<boolean>(false);

 useEffect(() => {
  // Optionally check session validity on hook mount
  const checkSession = async () => {
   try {
    // This could be a call to a `/session` endpoint that verifies the session
    await axios.get(`${API_BASE_URL}/session`);
    setIsLoggedIn(true);
   } catch (error) {
    console.error('Session check failed:', error);
    setIsLoggedIn(false);
   }
  };

  checkSession();
 }, []);

   // The API should set an HttpOnly cookie directly, no need to handle tokens here
   setIsLoggedIn(true);

I need your help getting the SAM deployment working to the point where I can start testing the `useAuth`

**Codeium** _at 12:32 pm, Jun 27, 2024_

Transitioning your AWS CloudFormation stack to AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) for deploying Lambda@Edge functions and integrating with Amazon Cognito and Amazon S3 involves several steps. AWS SAM simplifies the process of writing, deploying, and managing serverless applications. To help you get started, I'll outline the key components and provide a basic SAM template structure that aligns with your CloudFormation template.

### 1. Install AWS SAM CLI

Ensure you have the AWS SAM CLI installed and configured. Based on your message, it seems you have this part covered.

### 2. Initialize a SAM Project

Since you've already run `sam init` and selected the `hello-world` template, that's fine for getting started. You can replace the generated code with your specific application code later.

### 3. Convert CloudFormation to SAM Template

Your existing CloudFormation template can be adapted to a SAM template with some modifications. Below is a simplified example that includes a Cognito User Pool, User Pool Client, Identity Pool, S3 Bucket, and Lambda@Edge function:

```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Transform: AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31
Description: Example SAM template for HandTerm application.

Globals:
  Function:
    Timeout: 5

Resources:
  CognitoUserPool:
    Type: AWS::Cognito::UserPool
    Properties:
      UserPoolName: HandTermUserPool
      Schema:
        - Name: email
          Required: true
          Mutable: false
      Policies:
        PasswordPolicy:
          MinimumLength: 8
          RequireUppercase: true
          RequireLowercase: true
          RequireNumbers: true
          RequireSymbols: true

  CognitoUserPoolClient:
    Type: AWS::Cognito::UserPoolClient
    Properties:
      UserPoolId: !Ref CognitoUserPool
      ExplicitAuthFlows:
        - ALLOW_USER_SRP_AUTH
        - ALLOW_REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH
      GenerateSecret: false

  HandTermIdentityPool:
    Type: AWS::Cognito::IdentityPool
    Properties:
      IdentityPoolName: HandTermIdentityPool
      AllowUnauthenticatedIdentities: false
      CognitoIdentityProviders:
        - ClientId: !Ref CognitoUserPoolClient
          ProviderName: !GetAtt CognitoUserPool.ProviderName

  HandTermHistoryBucket:
    Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
    Properties:
      BucketName: handterm-history
      AccessControl: Private

  LambdaAtEdgeFunction:
    Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
    Properties:
      Handler: index.handler
      Runtime: nodejs16.x
      CodeUri: path/to/your/code/
      Description: A Lambda@Edge function for HttpOnly Cookies
      MemorySize: 128
      Role: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/your-lambda-execution-role
      # Note: Lambda@Edge does not support the usual Events property for triggering
      # You will need to manually attach this function to a CloudFront distribution
```

### 4. Update and Deploy SAM Template

- Replace the `CodeUri` with the path to your Lambda@Edge function code.
- Update the `Role` ARN to match your IAM role for Lambda execution.
- Lambda@Edge functions are associated with CloudFront distributions manually or via CloudFormation resource types outside of the `AWS::Serverless::Function` resource. You'll need to deploy your SAM application first, then manually add the function to your CloudFront distribution or update your stack to include CloudFront configuration referencing the deployed Lambda function ARN.

### 5. Deploy with SAM

Once your SAM template is ready:

1. Build your SAM application:
   ```bash
   sam build
   ```
2. Deploy your SAM application to AWS:
   ```bash
   sam deploy --guided
   ```

The `--guided` flag will walk you through the initial deployment setup, including setting up your stack name, AWS region, and outputting necessary changes.

### Next Steps

After deployment, ensure your `useAuth.ts` hook is correctly pointing to your API endpoints. You may need to modify the API base URL or endpoint paths based on how you've set up your API Gateway and Lambda functions.

This example covers the basics of translating your CloudFormation resources into SAM format. Depending on your application's complexity and specific requirements, further adjustments may be needed. AWS SAM documentation provides a comprehensive guide and reference for all the resources and properties you can use in your SAM template.

**User** _at 12:55 pm, Jun 27, 2024_

I have put that template into `handterm-app/template.yml` SAM.

Don't I have to include this:

```yml
 LambdaExecutionRole:
  Type: AWS::IAM::Role
  Properties:
   AssumeRolePolicyDocument:
    Version: '2012-10-17'
    Statement:
     - Effect: Allow
      Principal:
       Service:
        - lambda.amazonaws.com
        - edgelambda.amazonaws.com
      Action: sts:AssumeRole
   Policies:
    - PolicyName: LambdaS3Access
     PolicyDocument:
      Version: '2012-10-17'
      Statement:
       - Effect: Allow
        Action: s3:*
        Resource: !Sub arn:aws:s3:::handterm-history/*
```

Also, do I have to `aws cloudformation destroy` my existing `HandTermCognitoStack` first, since it is using the same identiy pool and user pool names?

---

**Codeium** _at 12:56 pm, Jun 27, 2024_

Yes, you're right. Including the `LambdaExecutionRole` in your AWS SAM template is necessary to define permissions for your Lambda function, especially if it interacts with AWS S3 or any other AWS services. Here's how you can incorporate the `LambdaExecutionRole` into your `template.yml`:

```yaml
  LambdaExecutionRole:
    Type: AWS::IAM::Role
    Properties:
      AssumeRolePolicyDocument:
        Version: 2012-10-17
        Statement:
          - Effect: Allow
            Principal:
              Service:
                - lambda.amazonaws.com
                - edgelambda.amazonaws.com
            Action: sts:AssumeRole
      Policies:
        - PolicyName: LambdaS3Access
          PolicyDocument:
            Version: 2012-10-17
            Statement:
              - Effect: Allow
                Action: s3:*
                Resource: !Sub arn:aws:s3:::handterm-history/*
```

Ensure to replace your Lambda function's `Role` property with a reference to this newly defined role. For example:

```yaml
  MyLambdaAtEdgeFunction:
    Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
    Properties:
      ...
      Role: !GetAtt LambdaExecutionRole.Arn
```

### Regarding Destroying Existing CloudFormation Stack

Before you proceed with `aws cloudformation destroy` on your existing `HandTermCognitoStack`, consider the following:

- **Impact on Resources:** Destroying the stack will remove all resources managed by it, including the Cognito User Pool, Identity Pool, and any other resources defined in the stack. If you have users or data in these services that you wish to retain, you should take caution.

- **Resource Names and Reusability:** If your SAM template uses the same resource names (e.g., User Pool Name, Identity Pool Name) and you plan to recreate these resources with the same names, deleting the existing stack may be necessary to avoid name conflicts. However, AWS resource names like S3 bucket names need to be globally unique, and Cognito Pool names need only be unique within an AWS account and region, but they are not reused immediately after deletion.

- **Migration Strategy:** If you're transitioning to a SAM-based deployment, consider how you will migrate or preserve any existing data or user accounts. For resources like Cognito User Pools, it might be necessary to export user data or to plan a migration strategy that does not require destroying the existing pool.

If you decide to proceed with destroying the existing stack, use the following AWS CLI command:

```bash
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name HandTermCognitoStack
```

Ensure you have backups or a migration plan in place for any data you wish to retain. After confirming the deletion of the old resources, you can safely deploy your new SAM-based stack without conflicts.

### Final Steps

After integrating the `LambdaExecutionRole` into your `template.yml` and resolving any conflicts with existing resources, you can proceed with deploying your SAM application. Use the `sam build` and `sam deploy --guided` commands as previously described to deploy your application to AWS.

When I run validate I get this:

```ps1
🕐[13:31:21]❯ sam validate --profile mark
W3045 Consider using AWS::S3::BucketPolicy instead of AccessControl
C:\Users\xgenx\source\repos\handex-react\handterm-sam\template.yaml:48:7

W2531 Runtime (nodejs16.x) was deprecated on 2024-06-12. Creation will be disabled on 2025-02-28 and update on 2025-03-31. Please consider updating to nodejs20.x
C:\Users\xgenx\source\repos\handex-react\handterm-sam\template.yaml:71:3

Error: Linting failed. At least one linting rule was matched to the provided template.
```

---

**Codeium** _at 1:36 pm, Jun 27, 2024_

The output you're seeing from `sam validate` is indicating two main points for consideration:

1. **Use of `AWS::S3::BucketPolicy` instead of `AccessControl`**: The warning suggests that instead of using the `AccessControl` attribute in your S3 bucket definition for managing permissions, you should use an `AWS::S3::BucketPolicy` resource. This approach provides finer control over the permissions.

2. **Deprecated Node.js Runtime**: The error message indicates that the Node.js runtime version `nodejs16.x` has been deprecated and will soon be unsupported for creating or updating AWS Lambda functions. It suggests upgrading to `nodejs20.x`.

### Addressing the S3 BucketPolicy Warning

To address the first warning, you might modify your S3 bucket definition to remove the `AccessControl` attribute and add a `BucketPolicy` resource. Here's an example adjustment:

```yaml
  HandTermHistoryBucket:
    Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
    Properties:
      BucketName: handterm-history

  HandTermHistoryBucketPolicy:
    Type: AWS::S3::BucketPolicy
    Properties:
      Bucket: !Ref HandTermHistoryBucket
      PolicyDocument:
        Version: "2012-10-17"
        Statement:
          - Sid: PublicReadGetObject
            Effect: Allow
            Principal: "*"
            Action: "s3:GetObject"
            Resource: !Sub "arn:aws:s3:::handterm-history/*"
```

Adjust the `PolicyDocument` according to the specific permissions you wish to set for your bucket.

### Addressing the Deprecated Node.js Runtime Error

To resolve the runtime deprecation warning, update the runtime version for your Lambda@Edge function to `nodejs20.x`. Make sure that your function's code is compatible with this newer runtime version.

```yaml
  MyLambdaAtEdgeFunction:
    Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
    Properties:
      ...
      Runtime: nodejs20.x
```

### Final Steps

After making these adjustments, your `template.yaml` should be updated to address both the S3 bucket policy best practice and the outdated runtime version. 

- Ensure your Lambda function code is compatible with Node.js 20.x.
- Review and adjust your S3 bucket policy permissions as needed for your application.

Once updated, run `sam validate --profile mark` again to ensure no further issues are reported. If the validation passes, you can proceed with building and deploying your SAM application using `sam build` and `sam deploy --guided`.

**Codeium** _at 1:46 pm, Jun 27, 2024_

The error message you're encountering during the `sam build` process indicates an issue with the `CodeUri` path specified for your Lambda function in the SAM template. The `CodeUri` is expected to point to a directory containing your Lambda function's code and any dependencies, but it appears to point directly to a `.js` file instead. This is why the build process is failing; it's looking for a directory to package, not just a single file.

### Solution

You should ensure that the `CodeUri` value in your `template.yaml` file points to a directory containing your Lambda function's code along with a `package.json` file (even if it's empty or minimal). The `package.json` is necessary for SAM to understand that it's dealing with a Node.js project and to manage any dependencies if they exist.

1. **Adjust the `CodeUri` in Your SAM Template**: Change the `CodeUri` property of your Lambda function to point to the directory containing your `http-only-cookies.js` file and a `package.json` file, not directly to the `.js` file.

If `http-only-cookies.js` is your main Lambda function file and it resides in a directory named `lambda`, your SAM template snippet for the function should look like this:

```yaml
  LambdaAtEdgeFunction:
    Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
    Properties:
      Handler: http-only-cookies.handler
      Runtime: nodejs20.x
      CodeUri: lambda/
      Description: A Lambda@Edge function for HttpOnly Cookies
      MemorySize: 128
      ...
```

In this example, I'm assuming that `http-only-cookies.js` and `package.json` reside within a directory named `lambda`.

2. **Add a `package.json` File**: In the directory where your Lambda function code resides (`lambda/` in this example), make sure there's a `package.json` file. If your function does not have any npm dependencies, the `package.json` can be minimal. Here's an example:

```json
{
  "name": "http-only-cookies",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A Lambda@Edge function for HttpOnly Cookies",
  "main": "http-only-cookies.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node http-only-cookies.js"
  }
}
```

3. **Retry Building Your SAM Application**: After making these adjustments, navigate to your project's root directory where the SAM template resides and run `sam build` again.

This should resolve the build failure by correctly identifying the directory structure and processing your Lambda function's code and any potential dependencies through `npm`.

Before moving to a SAM solution, I had been implementing the the Lambda@Edge in JS

```js
'use strict';

exports.handler = (event, context, callback) => {
  const response = event.Records[0].cf.response;
  const headers = response.headers;

  // Set HttpOnly Cookie
  headers['set-cookie'] = [{
    key: 'Set-Cookie',
    value: `handterm-history=YourCookieValue; Path=/; Secure; HttpOnly;`
  }];

  callback(null, response);
};
```

That is in `handterm-sam\hello-world\http-only-cookies.js`

Can you help me move the JS code into the `app.ts`?

I am also going to rename the `hello-world` folder.

Certainly! You can integrate your JavaScript Lambda@Edge function code into the TypeScript file (`app.ts`) created by `sam init`. This involves adapting the JavaScript code to TypeScript syntax and ensuring it's compatible with the TypeScript configurations used by AWS SAM for Lambda functions.

Here's how you can adapt your JavaScript Lambda@Edge function into the existing `app.ts` TypeScript file:

1. **Update the Handler Signature**: Since Lambda@Edge functions receive a CloudFront event, we'll adapt the handler signature in `app.ts` to match the expected input and output for a Lambda@Edge function that modifies HTTP response headers.

2. **Integrate the JavaScript Logic**: Incorporate the logic for setting the HttpOnly cookie into the TypeScript file.

3. **Error Handling**: We'll maintain basic error handling, though it's worth noting Lambda@Edge functions have some restrictions on logging and error handling due to their execution environment at the edge.

Here's the updated `app.ts` reflecting these changes:

```typescript
import { CloudFrontResponseEvent, CloudFrontResponseHandler, CloudFrontResponseResult } from 'aws-lambda';

export const lambdaHandler: CloudFrontResponseHandler = async (event: CloudFrontResponseEvent): Promise<CloudFrontResponseResult> => {
  const response = event.Records[0].cf.response;
  const headers = response.headers;

  // Set HttpOnly Cookie
  headers['set-cookie'] = [{
    key: 'Set-Cookie',
    value: `handterm-history=YourCookieValue; Path=/; Secure; HttpOnly;`
  }];

  return response;
};
```

### Key Points:

- **TypeScript Definitions**: The handler uses TypeScript definitions from the `aws-lambda` package for `CloudFrontResponseEvent` and `CloudFrontResponseResult`. These types ensure your code is type-safe and integrates well with the AWS Lambda runtime environment for CloudFront events.

- **Handler Signature**: The `lambdaHandler` function is defined as a `CloudFrontResponseHandler`, which correctly types the event parameter as a `CloudFrontResponseEvent`. This aligns with the use case of modifying CloudFront responses.

- **Return Type**: Lambda@Edge functions modifying CloudFront responses typically return the modified response object directly. The `Promise<CloudFrontResponseResult>` return type allows for asynchronous operation, although in this case, the operation is synchronous.

### Next Steps:

- **Rename `hello-world` Folder**: If you plan to rename the `hello-world` folder, ensure to update the `CodeUri` in your SAM `template.yaml` to point to the new location of your Lambda function code.

- **Deploy**: With your code updated, you can proceed to build and deploy your SAM application. Remember to test your Lambda@Edge function in a staging environment to ensure it behaves as expected before promoting changes to production.

This approach integrates your JavaScript functionality into a TypeScript Lambda function, leveraging TypeScript's type safety while maintaining the original functionality of setting an HttpOnly cookie in CloudFront responses.

I haven't run `yarn` yet because I am wondering if this SAM app should be in a subdirectory. Will it create another `node_modules` directory nested in the outer app with already has a `node_modules` directory?

Is that the best way?

---

**Codeium** _at 2:26 pm, Jun 27, 2024_

Having a SAM application within a larger project, such as a Yarn workspace, can indeed lead to some organizational and structural considerations. Specifically, regarding the `node_modules` directories, yes, if your SAM application has its own `package.json` and you run `yarn` or `npm install` within the SAM application directory, it will create a separate `node_modules` directory within that directory. This is actually a common and recommended approach for several reasons:

1. **Dependency Isolation**: Keeps the SAM application's dependencies isolated from the rest of your project. This is important because the Lambda runtime environment may require different versions of packages than your main application, or it might need packages that your main application doesn't.

2. **Deployment Optimization**: When you deploy your Lambda function, only the dependencies it actually needs are included. This can reduce the size of your deployment package, which can improve cold start times for your function.

3. **Development Workflow**: Separates the development workflows of your SAM application and the main project, making it easier to manage scripts, tools, and commands specific to the serverless application or the frontend part of your project.

### Best Practices for Project Structure

- **Subdirectory for SAM Application**: It's a good practice to keep the SAM application in a subdirectory of your main project if the main project includes more than just the serverless backend. This helps in maintaining a clear separation of concerns and makes the project easier to navigate.

- **Independent `package.json`**: Your SAM application should have its own `package.json` file, defining its specific dependencies and scripts. This file will be located in the same directory as your Lambda function code (e.g., in the `hello-world` or whatever name you choose for your Lambda function directory).

- **Separate `node_modules` Directories**: It's perfectly fine and expected to have multiple `node_modules` directories in a project like this. Tools like Yarn and npm are designed to handle nested `node_modules` directories and can optimize them for performance.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Ensure `CodeUri` Points to the Correct Directory**: In your `template.yaml`, the `CodeUri` property should point to the directory containing your Lambda function's `package.json` and `app.ts` (or whichever files constitute your Lambda function).

2. **Run `yarn` or `npm install` in the SAM Application Directory**: Navigate to your SAM application's directory (where its `package.json` is located) and run `yarn` or `npm install` to install the required dependencies locally. This will create a `node_modules` directory within this subdirectory.

3. **Deploy Your SAM Application**: Use `sam build` followed by `sam deploy --guided` to deploy your serverless application. The SAM CLI will package your Lambda function, including only its specific dependencies located in the subdirectory's `node_modules`.

By following this approach, you maintain a clean separation between the serverless backend and any other parts of your project, ensuring that each component has exactly what it needs without unnecessary overlap.

```

**Codeium** _at 2:56 pm, Jun 27, 2024_

The error message you're encountering indicates that the CloudFormation stack `handterm-sam` is in a `ROLLBACK_COMPLETE` state. This state usually occurs when a stack creation fails and CloudFormation rolls back any changes it made, effectively deleting any resources it created but leaving the stack itself in this terminal state. In this state, the stack cannot be updated or reused for a new deployment.

### Solutions

To resolve this issue, you have a few options:

#### 1. Delete the Stack and Redeploy

Since the stack is in a state where it can't be updated, the most straightforward solution is to delete the stack and then attempt to redeploy your application. You mentioned running a delete command previously, but it appears the stack may not have been fully deleted, or the command might have been targeting a different stack.

1. **Ensure the Stack is Completely Deleted**: Run the following command to delete the `handterm-sam` stack:

    ```powershell
    aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name handterm-sam
    ```

2. **Wait for the Stack to be Deleted**: You can monitor the AWS CloudFormation console to confirm that the stack has been fully removed. Alternatively, you can run the following command to describe the stack, which should eventually return an error once the stack is deleted:

    ```powershell
    aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name handterm-sam
    ```

    If the stack is successfully deleted, this command will return an error stating that the stack does not exist.

3. **Redeploy**: Once the stack is fully deleted, you can run `sam deploy --guided` again to create a new stack.

#### 2. Use a Different Stack Name

As an alternative, you can deploy your application using a new stack name. This can be done by specifying a different stack name when prompted during the `sam deploy --guided` process or by directly editing the `samconfig.toml` file to change the `stack_name` parameter under the deployment section.

### Additional Note

When deleting a stack, especially one that was associated with resources like Amazon Cognito User Pools or Identity Pools, make sure that you don't accidentally delete resources that you intend to keep or reuse. If you're planning to recreate resources with the same names or configurations, ensure that their deletion policies and any manual cleanup have been appropriately handled before redeploying.

The error message you're encountering indicates that the deployment failed due to an "Access Denied" error when attempting to create the `HandTermHistoryBucketPolicy`. This failure then caused the `LambdaAtEdgeFunction` creation to be canceled, leading to a rollback of the entire stack. The "Access Denied" error for the `BucketPolicy` is likely due to insufficient permissions for the AWS IAM user or role you're using to deploy the SAM application.

### Steps to Resolve the Issue

1. **Check IAM Permissions**: Ensure that the IAM user or role you're using to perform the deployment has sufficient permissions. Specifically, it needs permissions to create and manage S3 bucket policies, Lambda functions, Cognito resources, and IAM roles. You might need to attach policies like `AmazonS3FullAccess`, `AWSLambda_FullAccess`, `AmazonCognitoPowerUser`, and `IAMFullAccess` temporarily for the deployment, or preferably, more fine-grained permissions that cover the required actions.

2. **Review the S3 Bucket Policy**: The "Access Denied" error could also be a result of the specifics of the bucket policy you're trying to apply. Make sure that the policy doesn't contain any syntax errors and that it aligns with AWS's policy structure. If your bucket policy is meant to allow public access, AWS now requires you to explicitly enable public access settings on the S3 bucket, which can be done via the AWS Management Console or through the S3 API.

3. **Check S3 Block Public Access Settings**: AWS S3 has account-level and bucket-level "Block Public Access" settings. If your bucket policy is intended to grant public access to the bucket, these settings might be preventing the policy from being applied. You can review and adjust these settings in the AWS Management Console under the S3 service by selecting the bucket and looking under the "Permissions" tab.

4. **Retry Deployment with Increased Verbosity**: After checking and adjusting the permissions and the bucket policy, try deploying again. You can increase the verbosity of the `sam deploy` command to get more detailed output, which might help identify the issue:

    ```shell
    sam deploy --debug
    ```

5. **Manually Create Resources**: As a last resort, if automated deployment continues to fail, you could manually create the S3 bucket and apply the bucket policy via the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI, then remove those resources from your SAM template and deploy again. This approach is not ideal as it circumvents the benefits of infrastructure as code but can be used to unblock immediate issues.

### Additional Considerations

- **Customize the Error Message**: Adjust your SAM template or deployment process to better handle errors. This might involve customizing the bucket policy or reviewing how resources are defined in the SAM template.
- **Consult AWS Documentation**: AWS documentation on IAM policies, S3 bucket policies, and Lambda@Edge can provide further guidance on permissions and policy structures.
- **AWS Support**: If you continue to experience issues and have an AWS support plan, consider opening a support case for personalized assistance.

Resolving this issue will likely involve adjusting IAM permissions and ensuring that the S3 bucket policy is correctly formatted and allowed by your AWS account's settings.

The "Access Denied" error during the `HandTermHistoryBucketPolicy` creation process suggests a permission issue related to the S3 bucket policy you're trying to apply. This can happen for several reasons, including IAM permissions and S3's Block Public Access settings. Given the context and the template you've provided, here are a few steps to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:

### 1. Review IAM Permissions
Ensure the AWS account or role you're using to deploy the SAM application has the necessary permissions to create S3 bucket policies. Specifically, it needs `s3:PutBucketPolicy` permissions. If you're using an IAM role for deployment, make sure this role includes a policy allowing this action.

### 2. Check S3 Block Public Access Settings
The S3 bucket policy you're trying to create allows public access to the objects in the bucket (`"Principal": "*"`, allows actions for any user). AWS S3 Block Public Access settings can block the application of such policies at the account or bucket level.

- **Account Level**: Check the Block Public Access settings at the S3 service level in the AWS Management Console. Ensure that "Block public access to buckets and objects granted through new access control lists (ACLs)" and "Block public access to buckets and objects granted through any access control lists (ACLs)" are not blocking your policy.

- **Bucket Level**: Similarly, check the Block Public Access settings specifically for the `handterm-history` bucket.

You can adjust these settings in the AWS Management Console under S3 > your bucket > Permissions > Block Public Access settings.

### 3. Verify Bucket Ownership
Ensure that the AWS account you're using to deploy the SAM template owns the `handterm-history` bucket. If the bucket was created under a different account or has been transferred, you might encounter permission issues.

### 4. Manually Apply the Bucket Policy
As a temporary measure to isolate the issue, try applying the bucket policy manually through the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI. If this step fails, it confirms the issue is related to permissions or block public access settings. If it succeeds, the issue might be related to the deployment process or CloudFormation.

For the AWS CLI, you can use:
```shell
aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket handterm-history --policy file://policy.json
```
Where `policy.json` contains your bucket policy JSON.

### 5. Simplify the Bucket Policy
As a test, try simplifying or removing the `HandTermHistoryBucketPolicy` from your `template.yaml` to see if the deployment succeeds without it. This can help isolate the problem to the bucket policy itself rather than other parts of your template.

### Next Steps
Based on the outcome of these steps, you may need to adjust your deployment process, the bucket policy, or the IAM permissions used for deployment. 

If none of these steps resolve the issue, consider reviewing the exact IAM role and permissions attached to the role or user performing the deployment, and ensure there are no service control policies (SCPs) at the AWS Organizations level that might be restricting actions on S3 resources.

The bucket does not yet exist. 

```powershell
🕐[16:15:52]❯ aws s3 ls s3://handterm-history --profile mark --region us-east-1

An error occurred (NoSuchBucket) when calling the ListObjectsV2 operation: The specified bucket does not exist
```

I think that the `--profile mark` has the broadest admin privileges, but how can I check from the AWS CLI?

**Codeium** _at 4:19 pm, Jun 27, 2024_

To check the permissions associated with the AWS CLI profile "mark," you can use the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) CLI commands. However, it's important to note that directly querying the exact permissions of a profile or user isn't straightforward due to the way IAM policies work. Instead, you can check which IAM user or role is associated with the profile and then inspect the policies attached to that user or role.

### Step 1: Identify the IAM User or Role

First, determine which IAM user or role is associated with the "mark" profile by checking your AWS CLI configuration.

- Your CLI configuration files are located at `~/.aws/credentials` for the credentials and `~/.aws/config` for the configuration. Look for the `[mark]` section in these files to identify the IAM user or role.

If it's an IAM user, the credentials file will typically contain access keys (`aws_access_key_id` and `aws_secret_access_key`) associated with that user.

If it's an IAM role, especially for cross-account access or more complex setups, the config file might specify a role ARN to assume.

### Step 2: List Attached Policies

Once you've identified the IAM user or role, you can use the AWS CLI to list the policies attached to it.

#### If It's an IAM User:

```powershell
aws iam list-attached-user-policies --user-name <UserName> --profile mark
```

Replace `<UserName>` with the name of the IAM user associated with the "mark" profile.

#### If It's an IAM Role:

```powershell
aws iam list-attached-role-policies --role-name <RoleName> --profile mark
```

Replace `<RoleName>` with the name of the IAM role.

### Step 3: Describe Policies (Optional)

To see the details of each policy attached, you can use the following commands:

```powershell
aws iam get-policy --policy-arn <PolicyArn> --profile mark
```

And then:

```powershell
aws iam get-policy-version --policy-arn <PolicyArn> --version-id <VersionId> --profile mark
```

Replace `<PolicyArn>` with the ARN of the policy you're interested in, and `<VersionId>` with the version of the policy.

### Checking Inline Policies

Besides attached policies, users or roles might also have inline policies. You can list them with:

- For a user:

```powershell
aws iam list-user-policies --user-name <UserName> --profile mark
```

- For a role:

```powershell
aws iam list-role-policies --role-name <RoleName> --profile mark
```

### Note

Keep in mind that evaluating effective permissions can be complex due to policy inheritance, policy types (managed vs. inline), and potential service control policies (SCPs) if you're using AWS Organizations. The IAM Policy Simulator tool in the AWS Management Console can also help understand the effective permissions for IAM entities.

Should I add an S3 one? It's me and my account and I have root access so I don't mind granting myself full S3 access.

---

**Codeium** _at 4:29 pm, Jun 27, 2024_

Given the policies attached to the IAM user "mark" as you've listed, there isn't a specific S3 full access policy mentioned. Since you're encountering an "Access Denied" issue with S3 bucket policy operations and you're comfortable granting yourself full S3 access (especially considering this is your account and for development or testing purposes), adding Amazon S3 full access to your IAM user would be a straightforward way to resolve the permission issues related to S3.

### To attach the Amazon S3 full access policy:

1. **Using AWS Management Console**:
   - Navigate to the IAM service.
   - Find the user "mark".
   - On the user details page, click on the "Add permissions" button.
   - Choose "Attach existing policies directly".
   - Search for `AmazonS3FullAccess`.
   - Select the checkbox next to `AmazonS3FullAccess`.
   - Click on the "Next: Review" button, then click on "Add permissions".

2. **Using AWS CLI**:
   You can also attach the policy using the AWS CLI with the following command:

   ```powershell
   aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name mark --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3FullAccess --profile mark
   ```

### Considerations:

- **Least Privilege Principle**: While attaching `AmazonS3FullAccess` resolves the permission issue, it's generally recommended to follow the principle of least privilege by granting only the permissions necessary for the tasks you need to perform. Once you've completed your tasks that require broad permissions, consider scoping down the permissions or using more specific policies for routine operations.

- **Security Best Practices**: Be cautious when using accounts with broad permissions. Ensure your AWS credentials are kept secure and monitor for any unexpected access or usage patterns.

After attaching the `AmazonS3FullAccess` policy, you should be able to perform the S3 operations without encountering the "Access Denied" errors. This will allow your CloudFormation stack to create or modify the S3 bucket policy as defined in your SAM template.

What else can we check?

**Codeium** _at 4:47 pm, Jun 27, 2024_

Given that you've confirmed the `AmazonS3FullAccess` policy is attached to your IAM user "mark," and you're still encountering the "Access Denied" error when creating an S3 Bucket Policy, it suggests the issue might not be with IAM user permissions directly. Here are several other aspects and troubleshooting steps to consider:

### 1. **Check the S3 Block Public Access Settings Again**
Even with `AmazonS3FullAccess`, if the S3 bucket's Block Public Access settings are enabled, they can prevent the application of public access policies. This can occur despite having the necessary IAM permissions. Confirm that the Block Public Access settings for both the account and the specific bucket are set to allow your intended bucket policy.

- To check and modify Block Public Access settings for the specific bucket through AWS CLI, use:

```powershell
aws s3api get-bucket-public-access-block --bucket handterm-history --profile mark
```

- To modify these settings if they are blocking your policy, use:

```powershell
aws s3api put-bucket-public-access-block --bucket handterm-history --public-access-block-configuration "BlockPublicAcls=false,IgnorePublicAcls=false,BlockPublicPolicy=false,RestrictPublicBuckets=false" --profile mark
```

### 2. **Review the Specific Policy Being Applied**
The policy document you're attempting to apply grants public read access. Ensure there's no typo or configuration issue in the policy itself that could be causing the operation to be denied. The error could potentially be due to the specifics of what you're trying to allow rather than a blanket denial of your ability to modify policies.

### 3. **Use the AWS Policy Simulator**
The AWS Policy Simulator tool can help determine if the policy you're attempting to attach should be allowed based on the permissions of the IAM user "mark". This can help identify if there are unexpected denials coming from somewhere else in your account configuration.

- Access the AWS Policy Simulator [here](https://policysim.aws.amazon.com/).

### 4. **Inspect CloudTrail Logs**
AWS CloudTrail logs every API call in your AWS account. Inspect CloudTrail logs for the `PutBucketPolicy` event and look for any "Access Denied" events. The logs might provide additional context or details about why the request was denied.

- To view CloudTrail logs, you can go to the AWS CloudTrail console, or query them via AWS CLI.

### 5. **Temporary Policy Conflicts**
If there's a temporary policy (such as those applied via a Service Control Policy in AWS Organizations) that restricts S3 bucket policy modifications, it could override your IAM user's permissions. Review any such policies that might be in effect, especially if your account is part of an AWS Organization.

### 6. **Region-Specific Requirements**
Ensure there are no region-specific requirements or restrictions causing the issue. While it's less common for such issues to arise, AWS does have different endpoints and sometimes slightly different behaviors across regions. Ensure your AWS CLI profile and operations are targeting the correct region.

If after these steps you're still facing issues, you might want to simplify the deployment to further isolate the problem. For instance, try deploying the stack without the `HandTermHistoryBucketPolicy` to see if the issue is specifically with setting the bucket policy or if it might be related to another aspect of your CloudFormation stack or AWS environment.

---

**User** _at 4:50 pm, Jun 27, 2024_

The bucket still doesn't exist:

```powershell
🕐[16:48:16]❯ aws s3api get-public-access-block --bucket handterm-history --profile mark    

An error occurred (NoSuchBucket) when calling the GetPublicAccessBlock operation: The specified bucket does not exist
```

---

**Codeium** _at 4:50 pm, Jun 27, 2024_

Given the `NoSuchBucket` error when attempting to check the S3 bucket's public access block settings, it seems there's a misunderstanding in the flow of operations. Since the bucket does not exist yet due to the CloudFormation stack failing to deploy, you won't be able to modify or check settings directly on the S3 bucket using the AWS CLI.

The error during the stack creation indicates a failure when applying the S3 bucket policy (`HandTermHistoryBucketPolicy`), which suggests a permissions issue. However, since you have confirmed that the `AmazonS3FullAccess` policy is attached to your user, and the bucket doesn't exist because it's part of the CloudFormation template that fails to deploy, we need to approach this differently.

### New Approach to Troubleshoot

Let's try a different troubleshooting angle, considering the bucket's creation is part of the deployment process and hasn't succeeded yet:

1. **Retry Deployment Without S3 Bucket Policy**: Temporarily remove the `HandTermHistoryBucketPolicy` resource from your `template.yml` and attempt to deploy again. This will help determine if the issue is isolated to the policy application or if there might be broader permission issues at play.

2. **Manually Create the S3 Bucket and Apply Policy**: As a test, try creating the S3 bucket and applying the policy manually using the AWS CLI. This can help identify if the issue is with the CloudFormation service permissions or with S3 bucket policy permissions.

   - **Create the S3 bucket**:

     ```powershell
     aws s3api create-bucket --bucket handterm-history --region us-east-1 --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=us-east-1 --profile mark
     ```

   - **Apply the bucket policy manually** (ensure your policy JSON file is correctly formatted and located at `policy.json`):

     ```powershell
     aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket handterm-history --policy file://policy.json --profile mark
     ```

3. **Check CloudFormation Service Role**: If you're using a service role for CloudFormation (specified when deploying the stack), ensure that this role has the necessary permissions to create S3 buckets and apply bucket policies. If you're not specifying a service role, CloudFormation uses the permissions of the user calling the deploy command.

4. **Review CloudFormation Stack Policy**: If your stack has a stack policy, ensure that it doesn't restrict modifications to S3 resources. Stack policies can explicitly deny actions on certain resources, which could interfere with deployment.

5. **Deploy in Stages**: If manual creation and policy application works, try deploying your infrastructure in stages. First, deploy the stack without the S3 bucket policy, then update the stack with the policy as a separate update after confirming the bucket exists.

### Final Consideration

If these steps do not resolve the issue, it may be helpful to review any recent changes to AWS policies or service behaviors, though such changes are rare. Additionally, reaching out to AWS Support can provide more direct assistance, especially if there's an underlying issue with the service or your account.

The error message you're seeing related to the `CREATE_FAILED` status for `AWS::S3::BucketPolicy` (`HandTermHistoryBucketPolicy`) despite having removed the bucket policy section from your `template.yml` suggests that the AWS CloudFormation stack still includes a reference or attempt to create an S3 bucket policy that doesn't have the necessary permissions to be applied, or is being blocked by S3 Public Access settings.

Given that you've removed the bucket policy from your template and are still seeing references to an S3 bucket policy creation attempt, here are some steps to help resolve this issue:

### 1. **Clear Local Caches or Temporary Files**

Sometimes, deployment tools or environments might cache templates or deployment plans. Make sure you're not experiencing a cache issue by clearing any such caches or temporary files related to AWS SAM or CloudFormation. Restarting your deployment process or using a different terminal session might also help.

### 2. **Ensure You Are Deploying the Updated Template**

Verify that the command you're using for deployment is indeed using the updated version of your `template.yml` file without the S3 bucket policy section. It might be helpful to specify the template file explicitly in the `sam deploy` command if not already doing so:

```shell
sam deploy --template-file path/to/your/updated-template.yml --stack-name handterm-sam --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```

Replace `path/to/your/updated-template.yml` with the actual path to your SAM template file.

### 3. **Check for Nested Stacks or Included Resources**

Ensure that your CloudFormation stack doesn't include nested stacks or other resources that might be attempting to create or modify an S3 bucket policy. If your SAM application includes references to other CloudFormation templates or AWS SAM resources, verify that none of these are responsible for the attempted S3 bucket policy creation.

### 4. **Manual Stack Cleanup**

If the stack has partially created resources, it might be beneficial to delete the stack completely from the AWS CloudFormation console or using the AWS CLI, and then attempt a fresh deployment. This can help ensure that there are no residual resources or configurations causing conflicts:

```shell
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name handterm-sam --profile mark
```

Wait for the stack to be completely deleted before redeploying.

### 5. **Review AWS CloudFormation and SAM CLI Versions**

Check that you're using the latest versions of the AWS SAM CLI and AWS CLI. Sometimes, bugs or unexpected behaviors can be resolved by simply updating these tools to their latest versions.

### 6. **Deploy Using Verbose Logging**

Use verbose logging options when deploying to get more detailed output, which might provide additional clues about the issue:

```shell
sam deploy --debug --template-file path/to/your/updated-template.yml
```

This command will give you detailed output about what SAM is attempting to do, which might help identify why it's still trying to create an S3 bucket policy.

Check these areas, and if the issue persists, consider manually creating the resources through the AWS Management Console to isolate whether the issue is with CloudFormation/SAM deployment or with the AWS account permissions and settings.
