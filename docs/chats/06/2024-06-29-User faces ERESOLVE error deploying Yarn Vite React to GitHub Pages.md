The error you're encountering occurs because of a dependency resolution conflict within npm. The root of the issue is that `@testing-library/react-hooks` specifies it requires a peer dependency of React version `^16.9.0` or `^17.0.0`, but your project uses React version `18.3.1`. This version mismatch leads to the failure during the dependency resolution process.

Given your use of Yarn and npm in different contexts, here are a couple of solutions you can try to resolve this issue:

### 1. Use `--legacy-peer-deps` with npm

If you prefer to stick with npm for installing your dependencies, you can bypass the peer dependency conflict by using the `--legacy-peer-deps` option. This option tells npm to ignore peer dependency conflicts. You can modify your GitHub Actions workflow file to include this option when running `npm install`:

```yaml
- name: Install dependencies
  run: npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

This approach allows npm to install dependencies without resolving the peer dependency conflict, which should let your deployment process proceed. However, be aware that this might lead to runtime issues if `@testing-library/react-hooks` is not compatible with React version `18.3.1`.

### 2. Switch to Yarn in your GitHub Actions Workflow

Since your project uses Yarn, and Yarn is generally more lenient with peer dependencies than npm, switching to Yarn for your GitHub Actions workflow may resolve this issue without further configuration changes. Yarn's default behavior is similar to using `--legacy-peer-deps` in npm, but it integrates better with projects already using Yarn. Update your GitHub Actions workflow file to use Yarn commands:

```yaml
- name: Install dependencies
  run: yarn install
```

Make sure your project's root directory contains a `yarn.lock` file and potentially adjust any subsequent steps in your workflow that rely on npm to use Yarn commands instead.

### Additional Consideration: Update Dependencies

Consider checking if there's an updated version of `@testing-library/react-hooks` or any other related packages that adds support for React 18. Updating these packages might resolve the dependency conflict without requiring workarounds. You can check for updates by running:

```powershell
yarn upgrade-interactive --latest
```

This command provides an interactive UI to select package updates, helping to ensure compatibility with React 18.

Choosing between these options depends on your project's requirements and your preference for handling dependencies.

What if I want to remove `npm`? Some tools assume `npm` is being used and just run it and I have to keep removing the `package-lock.json`

I want to just use `yarn` if I can.

If you want to fully commit to using Yarn and avoid confusion or issues with `npm`, you can take several steps to ensure that Yarn is used exclusively for dependency management and script execution in your project. Here are some approaches to minimize inadvertent use of `npm`:

### 1. **Remove `package-lock.json` and Commit `yarn.lock`**

You've already noted the need to remove `package-lock.json` to avoid conflicts between package managers. Ensure that `yarn.lock` is committed to your repository to track dependency versions accurately.

```powershell
Remove-Item package-lock.json # Removes package-lock.json if exists
git add yarn.lock
git commit -m "Use Yarn for dependency management"
```

### 2. **Update Documentation and Contribution Guidelines**

Clearly state in your `README.md` and any contribution guidelines that Yarn is the package manager for the project. This can help set the expectation for other developers working on or contributing to the project.

```markdown
## Development Setup

This project uses [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for dependency management. Please ensure you have Yarn installed on your development machine.

To install dependencies, run:

```bash
yarn install
```
```

### 3. **Configure Build and Deployment Scripts**

Ensure all scripts in your `package.json`, CI/CD pipelines (like GitHub Actions), and any other automated processes use Yarn commands instead of `npm`. This change helps enforce the use of Yarn across all development and deployment workflows.

For GitHub Actions, you can switch to Yarn by updating the workflow files:

```yaml
- name: Install dependencies
  run: yarn install

- name: Build
  run: yarn build
```

### 4. **Use Yarn for Global Packages**

If you have global packages installed with `npm`, consider reinstalling them with Yarn. Note that Yarn handles global packages differently from npm, so you might not need to use global installations as frequently. For packages that need to be globally accessible, use:

```powershell
yarn global add package-name
```

Remember to remove the npm-installed global packages to avoid duplicates.

### 5. **Educate Team Members**

If you're working in a team, ensure all members are aware of the decision to use Yarn exclusively. Consider holding a brief session or sharing documentation on Yarn's benefits and how to use it for common tasks.

### 6. **Use `yarn dlx` Instead of `npx`**

For running packages that would typically be executed with `npx`, you can use `yarn dlx`. This command allows you to execute a package binary without permanently installing it globally:

```powershell
yarn dlx package-name
```

### 7. **Check for Implicit `npm` Usage**

Some development tools or IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) might default to using `npm`. Check the settings of your development environment to switch to Yarn if possible. For example, in Visual Studio Code, you might adjust task configurations that default to npm.

By taking these steps, you can help ensure that Yarn is the primary and sole package manager used in your project, minimizing the risks and confusion associated with using multiple package managers.
