I am in the process of working through with you the conversion of this AWS CDK stack from using a Rest API Gateway to using an HTTP API Gateway.

We are converting from a REST API to an HTTP API because you said that REST API cannot send muti-valued headers and we are implementing HttpOnly Cookies and we want to be able to get the username from the server. The application will also have to send text to the server and have it store the text in user-private S3 bucket paths in the bucket created in the CDK. It will also have a function for the user to retrieve those text strings.

We are using HttpOnly Cookies as a method to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.

Currently, I am getting this error:

```ts
Type 'LambdaIntegration' is missing the following properties from type 'HttpRouteIntegration': id, _bindToRoute, completeBindts(2739)
route.d.ts(100, 14): The expected type comes from property 'integration' which is declared here on type 'AddRoutesOptions'
```

On this line of code:

```ts
  httpApi.addRoutes({
   path: ENDPOINTS.api.TokenHandler,
   methods: [HttpMethod.GET],
   integration: tokenHandlerIntegration,
  })
```

The error you're encountering is because you're trying to use `LambdaIntegration` from the REST API Gateway (`aws-apigateway`) module with an HTTP API Gateway (`aws-apigatewayv2`). These two types of API Gateways in AWS CDK use different integration classes due to differences in their underlying implementations and capabilities.

For HTTP APIs, you should use integrations from the `aws-apigatewayv2-integrations` module, specifically `HttpLambdaIntegration` for Lambda functions, which you've already imported at the top of your file. You've correctly set up an `HttpLambdaIntegration` for your `signInLambda`, so you need to follow a similar approach for your `tokenHandlerLambda`.

Here's how you can fix the error:

Replace the `LambdaIntegration` with `HttpLambdaIntegration` for your `tokenHandlerLambda`. You've already imported `HttpLambdaIntegration`, so you just need to correctly apply it. Here's the corrected portion of your code:

```typescript
// Correctly create an HttpLambdaIntegration for the tokenHandlerLambda
const tokenHandlerIntegration = new HttpLambdaIntegration('token-handler-integration', tokenHandlerLambda);

// Now, use the correct integration with httpApi.addRoutes
httpApi.addRoutes({
  path: ENDPOINTS.api.TokenHandler,
  methods: [HttpMethod.GET],
  integration: tokenHandlerIntegration,
});
```

In this corrected code:
- A new `HttpLambdaIntegration` instance is created specifically for `tokenHandlerLambda`. The first argument is a unique ID for the integration within the CDK stack, and the second argument is the Lambda function to integrate with.
- This correct integration type is then passed to `httpApi.addRoutes`, which is compatible with HTTP APIs.

This change will resolve the TypeScript error because `HttpLambdaIntegration` provides the required properties and methods expected by the `addRoutes` method for an HTTP API Gateway's route integration.

The error message you're encountering suggests a conflict between different versions or instances of the AWS CDK libraries, specifically between the `aws-cdk-lib` and the individual `@aws-cdk` module namespaces. In AWS CDK version 2.x and later, all library modules were consolidated under `aws-cdk-lib`, and the use of individual `@aws-cdk/*` packages (e.g., `@aws-cdk/aws-lambda`, `@aws-cdk/aws-iam`) is no longer recommended or necessary.

The issue here is that the TypeScript compiler is detecting types for the `IRole` interface from two different sources, one from `aws-cdk-lib` (which is the correct and updated source) and another from `@aws-cdk/aws-iam` (which is likely coming from an incorrect import statement or dependency).

To resolve this issue, ensure the following:

1. **Consistent Import Statements**: Make sure all your CDK code imports from `aws-cdk-lib` and not from individual `@aws-cdk/*` packages. For example, use:
    ```typescript
    import { iam } from 'aws-cdk-lib';
    ```
   Instead of:
    ```typescript
    import * as iam from '@aws-cdk/aws-iam';
    ```

2. **Review `package.json` Dependencies**: Check your `package.json` file to ensure that there are no dependencies on individual `@aws-cdk/*` packages. All CDK functionality should be coming from `aws-cdk-lib` when using CDK version 2.x and above.

3. **Clean and Reinstall Node Modules**: After ensuring that all imports and dependencies are correctly pointing to `aws-cdk-lib`, remove your `node_modules` directory and the `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` file, and then run `npm install` or `yarn install` again to reinstall your dependencies. This ensures that there are no lingering references to the old packages.

4. **Check TypeScript Configuration**: Ensure that your `tsconfig.json` does not have any configurations that might lead to resolving types from older package versions.

After making these changes, try rebuilding your project. This should resolve the type conflict by ensuring that all types are resolved from the unified `aws-cdk-lib` package, which is the correct approach for AWS CDK version 2.x and later.

I don't understand what you are saying about the imports.

Can you be more specific about how it applies to these actual imports that I'm actually using in this file?

```ts
import { ENDPOINTS } from '../cdkshared/endpoints';
import {
 aws_cognito as cognito,
 aws_s3 as s3,
 aws_lambda as lambda,
 aws_iam as iam,
} from "aws-cdk-lib";
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import { HttpMethod, HttpApi, CorsHttpMethod } from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-apigatewayv2';
import { HttpLambdaIntegration } from '@aws-cdk/aws-apigatewayv2-integrations';
```

This is my `package.json`

```json

 "name": "cdk",
 "version": "0.1.0",
 "license": "Apache-2.0",

Given the `package.json` and the import statements you provided, the key issue here is the mixture of AWS CDK v2 (via `aws-cdk-lib`) with individual `@aws-cdk/*` packages, which are remnants of AWS CDK v1 and should not be used with AWS CDK v2.

### The Issue with Imports

Your current imports mix `aws-cdk-lib` (the consolidated package for AWS CDK v2) with an individual package import that is not compliant with AWS CDK v2 best practices:

```typescript
import { HttpLambdaIntegration } from '@aws-cdk/aws-apigatewayv2-integrations';
```

For AWS CDK v2 (`aws-cdk-lib`), all AWS service constructs are imported from `aws-cdk-lib` directly, without needing to reference the individual `@aws-cdk/*` libraries. 

However, for integrations like `HttpLambdaIntegration`, you would need to use the separate integration library compatible with `aws-cdk-lib`. The correct import for `HttpLambdaIntegration` in the context of AWS CDK v2 should come from `aws-cdk-lib/aws-apigatewayv2-integrations-alpha` or a similar package, but it appears there is a mistake in the use of the package name.

### Correcting the `package.json`

Your `package.json` explicitly includes an AWS CDK v1 package (`@aws-cdk/aws-lambda`) which should not be used with AWS CDK v2 (`aws-cdk-lib`). Here's how you can correct your `package.json`:

1. Remove the `@aws-cdk/aws-lambda` dependency.
2. Ensure all AWS CDK functionality is sourced from `aws-cdk-lib`.

The corrected dependencies section should look like this:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "aws-cdk-lib": "2.147.2",
  "aws-sdk": "^2.1651.0",
  "constructs": "^10.0.0",
  "dotenv": "^16.4.5",
  "source-map-support": "^0.5.21"
}
```

### Correcting the Imports

After cleaning up `package.json`, your imports should exclusively use `aws-cdk-lib` for CDK functionality. The problematic integration import needs to be updated or removed depending on whether you find a compatible version for AWS CDK v2. 

As of my last knowledge update, `aws-cdk-lib/aws-apigatewayv2-integrations-alpha` was the correct module for HTTP API integrations with Lambda in AWS CDK v2, but you need to check the latest AWS CDK documentation or package releases for the precise import path as these can change, especially for features that were in alpha or beta.

You might need to install a separate package for the alpha or beta integrations if it's not bundled directly with `aws-cdk-lib`. In this case, ensure your `package.json` is updated accordingly, and then adjust your import statement to match the installed package.

### Final Steps

After making these corrections:

1. Remove your `node_modules` directory and `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to clean install your dependencies.
3. Update your import statements in your TypeScript files according to the corrections described above.

If the `HttpLambdaIntegration` class is not available directly in `aws-cdk-lib`, you'll need to look for the correct library or approach for integrating Lambda functions with HTTP APIs in AWS CDK v2, which might involve using a different class or method for the integration.

**User** _at 9:27 am, Jul 1, 2024_

I've refreshed the `node_modules` using the process you described above. 

These are my current imports:

```ts
import { ENDPOINTS } from '../cdkshared/endpoints';
import {
 aws_cognito as cognito,
 aws_s3 as s3,
 aws_lambda as lambda,
 aws_iam as iam,
} from "aws-cdk-lib";
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import { HttpMethod, HttpApi, CorsHttpMethod } from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-apigatewayv2';
import { HttpLambdaIntegration } from '@aws-cdk/aws-apigatewayv2-integrations';
```

Can you tell me what the should be?

---

**Codeium** _at 9:28 am, Jul 1, 2024_

Based on your updated scenario and using AWS CDK v2 (`aws-cdk-lib`), you will need to adjust the import for `HttpLambdaIntegration` to align with the AWS CDK v2 libraries. However, as of my last update, `aws-cdk-lib` does not directly include HTTP API integrations for Lambda in the same way it does for other services. These integrations are provided by a separate library that is compatible with `aws-cdk-lib`.

Unfortunately, I might not have the most current package names due to the rapidly evolving nature of AWS CDK and its libraries. Previously, integrations for HTTP APIs in AWS CDK v1 were available under `@aws-cdk/aws-apigatewayv2-integrations`, but for AWS CDK v2, these might have been moved or restructured.

Here's how your imports should look if you're strictly using `aws-cdk-lib` for AWS CDK v2, with a placeholder for the correct import of `HttpLambdaIntegration`:

```typescript
import { ENDPOINTS } from '../cdkshared/endpoints';
import {
  aws_cognito as cognito,
  aws_s3 as s3,
  aws_lambda as lambda,
  aws_iam as iam,
  aws_apigatewayv2 as apigatewayv2,
  aws_apigatewayv2_integrations as apigatewayv2Integrations,
} from "aws-cdk-lib";
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import { HttpMethod, HttpApi, CorsHttpMethod } from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-apigatewayv2';

// Assuming the HttpLambdaIntegration is available in a compatible library or module, which might be named like 'aws-apigatewayv2-integrations' or similar
// This is a placeholder and might need adjustment based on the actual library or module name
import { HttpLambdaIntegration } from 'aws-cdk-lib/integrations'; // This path is illustrative and likely incorrect
```

Given this, you would need to:
1. Verify the correct library or module name for HTTP API integrations with Lambda in the context of AWS CDK v2. This might involve checking the AWS CDK documentation or GitHub repository for the latest information.
2. Install any necessary packages if they are not included in `aws-cdk-lib` by default. If a separate package is needed, ensure it is compatible with AWS CDK v2 and listed in your `package.json`.
3. Update the import statement for `HttpLambdaIntegration` accordingly.

As of my last update, the AWS CDK v2 documentation and package listings would be the best source to confirm the current status and import paths for HTTP API integrations.

**User** _at 9:35 am, Jul 1, 2024_

You removed the `cdk` import.

Now I get `Cannot find name 'cdk'.`

That seems counter-productive in a CDK module.

---

**Codeium** _at 9:35 am, Jul 1, 2024_

I apologize for the oversight. If you're using `cdk` as a prefix in your code (e.g., `cdk.Stack` or other CDK core constructs), you should indeed keep the import for `cdk` as you had it. Let's reintroduce the correct import statement for `cdk` along with the adjustments for AWS CDK v2 usage:

```typescript
import { ENDPOINTS } from '../cdkshared/endpoints';
import {
  aws_cognito as cognito,
  aws_s3 as s3,
  aws_lambda as lambda,
  aws_iam as iam,
  aws_apigatewayv2 as apigatewayv2,
  aws_apigatewayv2_integrations as apigatewayv2Integrations,
  App,
  Stack,
  StackProps,
} from "aws-cdk-lib";
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import { HttpMethod, HttpApi, CorsHttpMethod } from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-apigatewayv2';

// Correct import for HttpLambdaIntegration, assuming it's available in the correct library
// Note: As of my last update, you'll need to verify the correct import path for HttpLambdaIntegration in AWS CDK v2
import { HttpLambdaIntegration } from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-apigatewayv2-integrations-alpha'; // Verify the correct path based on your CDK version and available libraries

export class HandTermCdkStack extends Stack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);
    // Your stack definition...
  }
}
```

In this corrected version:
- The `cdk` prefix is not explicitly imported as a separate namespace. Instead, core constructs like `Stack` and `StackProps` are imported directly from `aws-cdk-lib`. This aligns with the best practices for AWS CDK v2, where all constructs and utilities are directly accessible from `aws-cdk-lib`.
- I reintroduced the `App`, `Stack`, and `StackProps` imports from `aws-cdk-lib` for defining your CDK stack. This is the correct way to use these core constructs in AWS CDK v2.
- The import for `HttpLambdaIntegration` is set to `'aws-cdk-lib/aws-apigatewayv2-integrations-alpha'`, but you should verify this path. The `-alpha` suffix indicates this might be part of an experimental or alpha release, so the actual import path can vary based on the latest CDK library releases and documentation.

Before proceeding, make sure to check the AWS CDK documentation for the most current information on importing and using HTTP API integrations with Lambda. The CDK API and packages can evolve, and newer releases might introduce changes to how integrations are handled.

**User** _at 9:52 am, Jul 1, 2024_

I see now. That looks much better.

I've implemented what you described above and it appears to be passing the linter.

I still have a couple of problems, though.

This section has errors because of the missing `cdk`

```ts
  // Outputs
  new cdk.CfnOutput(this, 'UserPoolId', { value: userPool.userPoolId });
  new cdk.CfnOutput(this, 'UserPoolClientId', { value: userPoolClient.userPoolClientId });
  new cdk.CfnOutput(this, 'IdentityPoolId', { value: identityPool.ref });
  new cdk.CfnOutput(this, 'BucketName', { value: logsBucket.bucketName });
  new cdk.CfnOutput(this, 'ApiEndpoint', { value: httpApi.url || '' });
```

And, I don't know what to do with the Cognito resource and how to integrate it with the HttpApi.

```ts
  // Assuming `api` is your HttpApi object and `userPool` is your Cognito User Pool
  const cognitoAuthorizer = new HttpApi.CognitoUserPoolsAuthorizer(this, 'CognitoAuthorizer', {
   cognitoUserPools: [userPool],
   identitySource: 'method.request.header.Authorization',
   authorizerName: 'CognitoAuthorizer'
  });
```

That throws the error:

```
Property 'CognitoUserPoolsAuthorizer' does not exist on type 'typeof HttpApi'.ts(2339)
```

---

**Codeium** _at 9:53 am, Jul 1, 2024_

Let's address both issues you're facing:

### 1. Using `CfnOutput`

For the outputs section where you're encountering errors due to the missing `cdk` prefix, since you've already imported `aws-cdk-lib`, you should directly use `CfnOutput` without the `cdk` prefix. However, we did not explicitly include `CfnOutput` in the corrected imports. Here's how you can adjust the imports and usage:

First, ensure `CfnOutput` is imported at the top of your file:

```typescript
import { CfnOutput } from "aws-cdk-lib";
```

Then, update your outputs section to use `CfnOutput` directly:

```typescript
// Outputs
new CfnOutput(this, 'UserPoolId', { value: userPool.userPoolId });
new CfnOutput(this, 'UserPoolClientId', { value: userPoolClient.userPoolClientId });
new CfnOutput(this, 'IdentityPoolId', { value: identityPool.ref });
new CfnOutput(this, 'BucketName', { value: logsBucket.bucketName });
new CfnOutput(this, 'ApiEndpoint', { value: httpApi.url || '' });
```

### 2. Integrating Cognito with HttpApi

The error you're seeing with `CognitoUserPoolsAuthorizer` is because the way it's being used doesn't match how constructs are defined in AWS CDK v2 (`aws-cdk-lib`). In AWS CDK v2, you should use `HttpUserPoolAuthorizer` from the `aws-apigatewayv2-authorizers` module for HTTP APIs.

Firstly, ensure you have the correct import for `HttpUserPoolAuthorizer`. Since this might be part of an integration package or has a specific import path in `aws-cdk-lib`, let's assume a corrected import statement based on the `aws-cdk-lib` structure:

```typescript
import { HttpUserPoolAuthorizer } from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-apigatewayv2-authorizers';
```

Then, you can define the authorizer and attach it to your routes like so:

```typescript
// Define the Cognito user pool authorizer for HTTP API
const cognitoAuthorizer = new HttpUserPoolAuthorizer('CognitoAuthorizer', userPool);

// Add routes with the authorizer
httpApi.addRoutes({
  path: '/your-protected-path',
  methods: [HttpMethod.GET],
  integration: yourIntegration,
  authorizer: cognitoAuthorizer,
});
```

In this setup:
- `HttpUserPoolAuthorizer` is correctly instantiated with a name and the `userPool` you've defined.
- When adding routes to `httpApi`, you can now specify the `authorizer` in the route options.

Ensure you replace `/your-protected-path` and `yourIntegration` with the actual path you're securing and the Lambda integration (or another integration) you're using for that route.

If `HttpUserPoolAuthorizer` does not import as shown (due to package updates or my outdated information), please refer to the latest AWS CDK documentation for `aws-cdk-lib` to find the correct import path for HTTP API Cognito authorizers.

Ok, almost everything is passing the linter except in here, the `grandRead` does not exist on the `userPoolClient`. I'm not sure how to populate the `integration`

```ts
  // Cognito User Pool
  const userPool = new cognito.UserPool(this, 'HandTermUserPool', {
   userPoolName: 'HandTermUserPool',
   selfSignUpEnabled: true,
   userVerification: {
    emailSubject: 'Verify your email for our app!',
    emailBody: 'Hello {username}, Thanks for signing up to our app! Your verification code is {####}',
    emailStyle: cognito.VerificationEmailStyle.CODE,
   },
   signInAliases: {
    email: true
   },
   passwordPolicy: {
    minLength: 8,
    requireUppercase: true,
    requireLowercase: true,
    requireDigits: true,
    requireSymbols: true,
   },
   autoVerify: { email: true }
  });

  // Cognito User Pool Client
  const userPoolClient = userPool.addClient('AppClient', {
   authFlows: {
    userSrp: true,
    userPassword: true // Enable USER_PASSWORD_AUTH flow
   },
   generateSecret: false,
   // Add your API Gateway endpoint URL to the list of callback URLs
  });

  // Define the HTTP API
  const httpApi = new HttpApi(this, 'HandTermApi', {
   apiName: 'HandTermService',
   description: 'This service serves authentication requests.',
   // CORS configuration if needed
   corsPreflight: {
    allowOrigins: ['*'],
    allowMethods: [CorsHttpMethod.GET, CorsHttpMethod.POST, CorsHttpMethod.OPTIONS],
    allowHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization'],
   },
  });

  // Cognito Identity Pool
  const identityPool = new cognito.CfnIdentityPool(this, 'HandTermIdentityPool', {
   identityPoolName: 'HandTermIdentityPool',
   allowUnauthenticatedIdentities: false,
   cognitoIdentityProviders: [{
    clientId: userPoolClient.userPoolClientId,
    providerName: userPool.userPoolProviderName,
   }],
  });

  // Assuming `api` is your HttpApi object and `userPool` is your Cognito User Pool
  const cognitoAuthorizer = new HttpUserPoolAuthorizer('CognitoAuthorizer', userPool);
  httpApi.addRoutes({
   path: '/api',
   methods: [HttpMethod.GET, HttpMethod.POST],
   integration: new HttpLambdaIntegration('CognitoAuthorizer', userPoolClient.grantRead(userPool).lambdaIntegration),
   authorizer: cognitoAuthorizer
  })
```

It looks like there's a misunderstanding in how you're trying to integrate the Cognito user pool client with the `HttpLambdaIntegration` and the use of `userPoolClient.grantRead(userPool).lambdaIntegration`. The `grantRead` method and `lambdaIntegration` property do not exist on the `userPoolClient` object in the AWS CDK for a Cognito user pool client. The integration for an HTTP API route should be with a Lambda function, not directly with a Cognito user pool client.

Here's what you typically want to do when integrating a route with a Lambda function and securing it with a Cognito authorizer:

1. **Create a Lambda Function**: First, ensure you have a Lambda function that you wish to invoke through your HTTP API. This function will handle the requests coming to the path you're securing with Cognito.

2. **Set up `HttpLambdaIntegration`**: Next, create an `HttpLambdaIntegration` instance using your Lambda function. This integration is what you'll use in the `integration` field when adding routes.

3. **Secure the Route with a Cognito Authorizer**: Use the `HttpUserPoolAuthorizer` you've already set up for securing the route.

Here's a corrected snippet based on these steps:

```typescript
// Example Lambda function for handling requests
const exampleLambdaFunction = new lambda.Function(this, 'ExampleFunction', {
  runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_14_X,
  handler: 'example.handler',
  code: lambda.Code.fromAsset('path/to/your/lambda/code'),
  // Additional configuration as needed
});

// Create an HttpLambdaIntegration with the Lambda function
const exampleLambdaIntegration = new HttpLambdaIntegration('ExampleLambdaIntegration', exampleLambdaFunction);

// Define the HTTP API
const httpApi = new HttpApi(this, 'HandTermApi', {
  apiName: 'HandTermService',
  description: 'This service serves authentication requests.',
  // CORS configuration if needed
  corsPreflight: {
    allowOrigins: ['*'],
    allowMethods: [CorsHttpMethod.GET, CorsHttpMethod.POST, CorsHttpMethod.OPTIONS],
    allowHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization'],
  },
});

// Cognito User Pool Authorizer
const cognitoAuthorizer = new HttpUserPoolAuthorizer('CognitoAuthorizer', userPool);

// Secure the route with the Cognito Authorizer
httpApi.addRoutes({
  path: '/api',
  methods: [HttpMethod.GET, HttpMethod.POST],
  integration: exampleLambdaIntegration,
  authorizer: cognitoAuthorizer,
});
```

Ensure you replace `'path/to/your/lambda/code'` with the actual path to your Lambda function code and adjust the `runtime` and `handler` as necessary for your Lambda function. This setup defines a Lambda function, integrates it with your HTTP API, and secures the route using the Cognito authorizer.

**User** _at 10:27 am, Jul 1, 2024_

Ok, that looks more straightforward and understandable. The CDK project builds, also.

Now I have a question about HttpOnly Cookies.

I currently have this in the `signIn.ts`

```ts
  // Concatenate the Set-Cookie strings into a single header value
  const setCookieHeader = [
   `idToken=${IdToken}; Secure; HttpOnly; Path=/`,
   `accessToken=${AccessToken}; Secure; HttpOnly; Path=/`,
   `refreshToken=${RefreshToken}; Secure; HttpOnly; Path=/`
  ].join(', ');

  return {
   statusCode: 200,
   headers: {
    "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
    "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials": true,
    "Set-Cookie": setCookieHeader,
   },
   body: JSON.stringify(data.AuthenticationResult),
  };
```

I want to provide the recommended level of security to prevent XSS by using HttpOnly Cookies, but I don't know how to handle subsequent HTTP requests.

I want to be able to request server content strings stored in S3, and I want to be able to store user-private data into an S3 bucket user folder.

Does the `Set-Cookie` code look like it complies with the HTTP API?

How do I make a request from the client and have the server know which client I am, so that the server can store and retrieve data from the proper S3 path? (The S3 content will only be accessed through the app and there is no need for direct IAM user access to IAM-restricted bucket paths)

---

**Codeium** _at 10:28 am, Jul 1, 2024_

Your `Set-Cookie` header setup in the `signIn.ts` Lambda function looks good for setting HttpOnly cookies, which is a recommended practice to help mitigate the risk of client-side script access (XSS attacks) by not allowing JavaScript access to the cookies. Your use of `Secure; HttpOnly; Path=/` with the cookies ensures they are sent over HTTPS and not accessible through JavaScript, which is aligned with security best practices.

### Compliance with HTTP API

The `Set-Cookie` code complies with HTTP standards for setting cookies, and AWS Lambda@Edge or API Gateway can return these headers to set cookies in the client's browser. However, ensuring compliance with the HTTP API (`aws_apigatewayv2.HttpApi` in AWS CDK) also involves ensuring that the API's CORS configuration supports credentials. Since you're using `"Access-Control-Allow-Credentials": true`, you must also specify an explicit domain in the `"Access-Control-Allow-Origin"` header instead of `"*"`. For example, if your frontend is hosted at `https://www.example.com`, the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` should be set to `https://www.example.com`.

### Handling Subsequent HTTP Requests

For subsequent requests from the client, the browser will automatically send the cookies along with each request to the same domain as long as the request type, API endpoint, and conditions meet the criteria defined when setting the cookies (`Secure; HttpOnly; Path=/`). On the server side (in your Lambda functions), you can then read these cookies from the incoming request headers to identify the user.

### Storing and Retriepping Data in S3

To store and retrieve data from S3 based on the user, you would typically:

1. **Identify the User**: Use the information in the tokens (e.g., `idToken` or `accessToken`) to identify the user. You might decode the `idToken` to extract the user's unique identifier (like `sub` in JWT) within your Lambda function.

2. **Define S3 Bucket and Key Structure**: Organize user data in S3 with a clear key structure that includes the user's identifier. For example, `user_data/{userId}/file.txt`.

3. **Lambda Permissions**: Ensure your Lambda function has the necessary IAM permissions to read/write from/to the specific paths in the S3 bucket. Use least privilege principles to restrict access only to paths necessary for each function.

4. **Server-Side Processing**: When a request comes in to retrieve or store user data, the Lambda function should parse the cookies to extract the token, identify the user, and then perform the necessary S3 operations (using the AWS SDK) based on the user's identifier.

Here's a simplified example of how you might extract the token from the cookies in a Lambda function (note that you'll need to parse the `Cookie` header to get the specific token you're interested in):

```typescript
exports.handler = async (event) => {
    const cookies = event.headers['Cookie'] || event.headers['cookie'];
    // Parse the cookies to extract needed tokens
    // Example: const idToken = parseCookies(cookies).idToken;
    
    // Identify the user from the token and proceed with S3 operations
    // Example: const userId = decodeToken(idToken).sub;
    
    // Example S3 operation
    // const objectKey = `user_data/${userId}/data.txt`;
    // const s3Response = await s3.getObject({ Bucket: YOUR_BUCKET_NAME, Key: objectKey }).promise();
    
    return {
        statusCode: 200,
        body: JSON.stringify({ message: "Operation Successful" }),
    };
};
```

This example assumes you have a function `parseCookies` to parse the `Cookie` header and a function `decodeToken` to decode the JWT token. You'll need to implement or use existing libraries for these functionalities according to your specific requirements and programming language.

**User** _at 10:53 am, Jul 1, 2024_

That is very good. That's what I wanted to hear.

I have this code now:

```ts
import * as AWS from 'aws-sdk';
import { ENDPOINTS } from '../../cdkshared/endpoints';
const cognito = new AWS.CognitoIdentityServiceProvider({ region: 'us-east-1' });

export const handler = async (event: any) => {
  const { username } = JSON.parse(event.body);
  const cookies = event.headers['Cookie'] || event.headers['cookie'];

  try {
    const user = await cognito
      .adminGetUser({
        UserPoolId: 'us-east-1_3q5q5j5q5q',
        Username: username
      })
      .promise();
    // Parse the cookies to extract needed tokens
    const idToken = parseCookies(cookies).idToken;

    // Identify the user from the token and proceed with S3 operations
    const userId = decodeToken(idToken).sub;

    // Example S3 operation
    const objectKey = `user_data/${userId}/data.txt`;
    const s3Response = await s3.getObject({ Bucket: ENDPOINTS.aws.s3.bucketName, Key: objectKey }).promise();
    return { statusCode: 200, body: JSON.stringify(user) };
  } catch (err) {
    return { statusCode: 500, body: JSON.stringify(err) };
  }
}
```

I am not sure what the best way to import S3 into a CDK Lambda function is.

I want to return "Not profile stored yet" if the `data.txt` doesn't exist.

I need your help creating the `parseCookies` and `decodeToken` functions.

---

**Codeium** _at 10:53 am, Jul 1, 2024_

To address each of your concerns:

### Importing S3 into a CDK Lambda Function

You already have the `AWS SDK` imported, which includes the S3 service. To use S3 in your Lambda function, instantiate it similarly to how you've done with Cognito:

```typescript
const s3 = new AWS.S3();
```

Ensure your Lambda function's execution role has the necessary permissions to access the S3 bucket and perform `getObject` operations.

### Handling "Not profile stored yet"

To handle the scenario where the `data.txt` file does not exist, you can catch the specific error thrown by the `getObject` call when the file is not found. AWS SDK for JavaScript throws an error with the code `NoSuchKey` for this case:

```typescript
try {
  const s3Response = await s3.getObject({ Bucket: ENDPOINTS.aws.s3.bucketName, Key: objectKey }).promise();
  // If the file is found, return its content
  const fileContent = s3Response.Body.toString('utf-8');
  return { statusCode: 200, body: JSON.stringify({ content: fileContent }) };
} catch (err) {
  if (err.code === 'NoSuchKey') {
    // Return a specific message if the file does not exist
    return { statusCode: 404, body: JSON.stringify({ message: "Not profile stored yet" }) };
  }
  // Handle other errors
  return { statusCode: 500, body: JSON.stringify(err) };
}
```

### Creating `parseCookies` and `decodeToken` Functions

You'll need utility functions to parse cookies and decode JWT tokens.

#### `parseCookies` Function

This function takes the `Cookie` header string, splits it into individual cookies, and returns an object mapping cookie names to values:

```typescript
function parseCookies(cookieHeader: string) {
  const cookies = {};
  cookieHeader.split(';').forEach(cookie => {
    const [name, value] = cookie.trim().split('=');
    cookies[name] = value;
  });
  return cookies;
}
```

#### `decodeToken` Function

To decode a JWT token, you can use a library like `jsonwebtoken` (you'll need to include it in your Lambda's deployment package). The `jsonwebtoken` library provides a `decode` method that can parse the JWT without verifying its signature, which might be sufficient for extracting the user ID (`sub`).

First, install `jsonwebtoken` in your project:

```sh
npm install jsonwebtoken
```

Then, use it in your Lambda function:

```typescript
import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken';

function decodeToken(token: string) {
  return jwt.decode(token);
}
```

Remember, `jwt.decode` does not validate the token. If you need to validate the token (which is usually the case for security reasons), you'll need to verify the token using `jwt.verify` and provide the necessary secret or public key, which might be more complex due to the need to manage keys or secrets within your Lambda function.

With these components, your Lambda function should be equipped to handle the retrieval of user-specific files from S3, respond appropriately when files are not found, and parse cookies and JWT tokens to extract user information.

**Codeium** _at 11:15 am, Jul 1, 2024_

The error you're seeing indicates that TypeScript is unable to find the type definitions for the `jsonwebtoken` module. TypeScript relies on these definitions to understand the types and structures of external JavaScript libraries.

To resolve this issue, you should install the type definitions for `jsonwebtoken`. These definitions are often available in DefinitelyTyped, a repository of high-quality TypeScript type definitions, and can be installed via npm.

Based on the suggestion in the error message, run the following command in your project directory:

```powershell
npm i --save-dev @types/jsonwebtoken
```

This command installs the type definitions for `jsonwebtoken` as a development dependency, which should resolve the TypeScript error. After installing, TypeScript will be able to recognize the types from the `jsonwebtoken` library, and you should no longer see the error.

Remember, the `--save-dev` option is used because type definitions are only needed during development and compilation; they aren't required at runtime.

If you run into any more issues or if `@types/jsonwebtoken` doesn't cover all the usages you need, you might have to manually declare types for any uncovered parts or extend the types in a custom `.d.ts` file in your project. However, for most use cases, the `@types/jsonwebtoken` package should suffice.

**User** _at 11:17 am, Jul 1, 2024_

I am using Yarn, so I ran `yarn add jsonwebtoken --dev`. Is that right?

---

**Codeium** _at 11:17 am, Jul 1, 2024_

Yes, using `yarn add jsonwebtoken --dev` is the correct way to add a development dependency when you're using Yarn as your package manager. This command installs the `jsonwebtoken` library into your project's `node_modules` directory and adds it to the `devDependencies` section of your `package.json` file. 

However, based on the error message you received, you specifically need to install the TypeScript type definitions for `jsonwebtoken`, not the library itself (which it seems you already have installed). The type definitions are provided by the `@types/jsonwebtoken` package. To install this using Yarn, you should run:

```powershell
yarn add @types/jsonwebtoken --dev
```

This command will add the type definitions for `jsonwebtoken` to your project, allowing TypeScript to understand the types used by the `jsonwebtoken` library and resolving the error you encountered.

**Codeium** _at 11:20 am, Jul 1, 2024_

The error you're encountering now is due to the way TypeScript is trying to import the `jsonwebtoken` module. By default, `jsonwebtoken` and many other CommonJS modules do not have a default export, but the syntax you're using (`import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken';`) is attempting to import it as if it had a default export.

To resolve this, you can change your import statement to use the `* as` syntax, which is the correct way to import CommonJS modules that export multiple members or do not have a default export:

```typescript
import * as jwt from 'jsonwebtoken';
```

This change tells TypeScript to import the entire module namespace (all exported members) under the alias `jwt`, which is compatible with how the `jsonwebtoken` module exports its members.

After making this adjustment, your TypeScript compiler should be able to process the import correctly, and you should no longer see the error during the build process.

**User** _at 11:27 am, Jul 1, 2024_

There is some dificulty with the `decodeToken()`

```
Object is possibly 'null'.ts(2531)
⚠ Error (TS2531)  | 
```

That is on:

```ts
    const userId = decodeToken(idToken).sub;
```

---

**Codeium** _at 11:28 am, Jul 1, 2024_

The TypeScript error `Object is possibly 'null'` indicates that the TypeScript compiler has identified a code path where the `decodeToken(idToken)` call could return `null`, and thus accessing `.sub` directly on the result could cause a runtime error if `decodeToken` indeed returns `null`. 

The `jwt.decode` function can return `null` if the token is not valid or cannot be decoded for some reason. To handle this safely in TypeScript, you should add a check to ensure that the result of `decodeToken` is not `null` before attempting to access its properties:

```typescript
const decodedToken = decodeToken(idToken);
if (!decodedToken) {
  // Handle the case where the token cannot be decoded
  return { statusCode: 400, body: JSON.stringify({ error: "Invalid token" }) };
}

// If the token is successfully decoded, proceed with using the decodedToken object
const userId = decodedToken.sub;
```

This way, you explicitly handle the case where `decodeToken` returns `null`, and TypeScript knows that beyond the check, `decodedToken` cannot be `null`, thus resolving the type error.

It's also worth noting that `jwt.decode()` will only decode the payload without verifying the integrity or the signature of the token. In scenarios where you need to verify the token (which is common for authentication and authorization purposes), you should use `jwt.verify()` instead, and provide the necessary secret or key for verification. Verification would typically be done in an environment where the secret or key is securely stored and not exposed to the client.

Do I need to destroy or delete the old stack first?

I have no need to keep any of it. I can delete the bucket and all the users, if need be.

---

**Codeium** _at 11:42 am, Jul 1, 2024_

The error message you're seeing, `Update of resource type is not permitted. The new template modifies resource type of the following resources: [HandTermApi1BECDD2E]`, indicates that the CloudFormation deployment is attempting to change the type of an existing resource in a way that's not supported by an update operation. Some types of changes to existing resources require the resource to be recreated, which CloudFormation cannot do within a single update operation if it changes the fundamental nature of the resource (like changing its type).

If you're okay with deleting the existing resources and starting fresh, you have a couple of options:

### Option 1: Manually Delete the Stack

You can manually delete the CloudFormation stack through the AWS Management Console or by using the AWS CLI. This will remove all resources managed by the stack, including the problematic resource, allowing you to redeploy from scratch.

To delete the stack using the AWS CLI, you can run the following command:

```powershell
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name HandTermCdkStack
```

Wait for the stack deletion to complete before redeploying your CDK application.

### Option 2: Use CDK Commands

Since you're working with the AWS CDK, you can use CDK commands to manage the stack directly. To destroy the stack and all its resources, you can run:

```powershell
cdk destroy HandTermCdkStack
```

This command asks for confirmation before proceeding to delete the stack and its resources. After confirming, it will proceed with the deletion.

Once the stack is successfully deleted, you can redeploy your application:

```powershell
cdk deploy HandTermCdkStack
```

This will create a new stack with your resources defined in the CDK application.

### After Deletion

If you choose to delete and recreate the stack, make sure to review any resources not managed by CloudFormation or the CDK, such as manually created S3 objects or IAM users, as these might need to be handled separately.

Remember, deleting the stack will remove all resources defined in it, so ensure you have backups or exports of any data you need from services like S3 or DynamoDB before proceeding.

It is working. I have deployed it successfully. 

Is there a way to autoconfirm new users? I want to do that until I go into production.

Also, how do I test now? My `useAuth.http` doesn't receive the cookies in the response:

```httpResponse
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Mon, 01 Jul 2024 18:59:32 GMT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 171
Connection: close
Apigw-Requestid: aPxnHilkIAMEZ_Q=

{
  "UserConfirmed": false,
  "CodeDeliveryDetails": {
    "Destination": "m***@w***",
    "DeliveryMedium": "EMAIL",
    "AttributeName": "email"
  },
  "UserSub": "e4e8e4b8-80c1-7014-03e6-7699fbaf2606"
}

```

Do I have to do all the testing in the browser?

### Auto-confirming New Users

To auto-confirm new users in Amazon Cognito during development, you can use a Pre-Signup Lambda trigger. This trigger allows you to automatically verify email addresses or phone numbers, set custom attributes, and auto-confirm users.

Here's how you can set it up:

1. **Create a Lambda function** that will be invoked by the Pre-Signup trigger:

    ```javascript
    exports.handler = async (event) => {
      event.response.autoConfirmUser = true;
      event.response.autoVerifyEmail = true; // If you want to auto-verify email addresses
      event.response.autoVerifyPhone = true; // If you want to auto-verify phone numbers
      return event;
    };
    ```

2. **Assign this Lambda function as a Pre-Signup trigger** for your user pool. You can do this in the AWS Management Console under the "Triggers" section of your user pool settings, or you can modify your CDK stack to include this trigger if you're managing your Cognito User Pool with CDK. Here's an example of how you might do it with CDK:

    ```typescript
    import * as cognito from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-cognito';
    import * as lambda from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda';

    const preSignupLambda = new lambda.Function(this, 'PreSignupLambda', {
      runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_14_X,
      handler: 'preSignup.handler',
      code: lambda.Code.fromAsset('path/to/your/lambda/code'),
    });

    userPool.addTrigger(cognito.UserPoolOperation.PRE_SIGN_UP, preSignupLambda);
    ```

    Replace `'path/to/your/lambda/code'` with the actual path to your Lambda function's code.

### Testing Without Receiving Cookies

If your `useAuth.http` call isn't receiving the cookies in the response, it might be due to the nature of how HTTP clients or tools (like Postman or curl) handle cookies differently from web browsers, especially when it comes to setting HttpOnly cookies.

For testing endpoints that set Http/DOM properties (like cookies), using a browser or a browser-based tool is usually necessary to accurately simulate the end-to-end behavior, including cookie handling.

To test in a browser, you could:

1. **Create a simple HTML/JavaScript page** that makes the HTTP request to your backend and logs the response. Ensure this page is served over HTTPS if your cookies are set with the `Secure` attribute.

2. **Use browser developer tools** to inspect the response headers and the browser's storage to confirm that the cookies are being set correctly.

3. **Test your application's flow** as it would work in production, by making requests from your frontend application hosted on a web server, observing how it interacts with your backend, and ensuring the cookies are handled as expected.

Remember, when testing in a non-production environment, it's a good idea to use test accounts or data rather than any real user information.
