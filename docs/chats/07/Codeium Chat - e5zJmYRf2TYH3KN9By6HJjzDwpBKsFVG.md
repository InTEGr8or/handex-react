I am trying to implement HttpOnly Cookies in my React static website web TUI. 

I have deployed the CDK in my `cdk/`, so I have a record of what is there.

I can log in and I receive an accss token, and I can see that a cookie gets created after the login.

When I execute a `getUser` request, it's supposed to parse the cookie from the HTTP Request headers, but there is no cookie in the request.

I have the `getUser` Lambda logging out the whole event:

```json
2024-07-02T02:30:10.674Z	8957a840-cd5b-4013-a138-77e725adb9ff	INFO	getUser received event: {

  },

}
```

The client-side request looks like this:

```ts
 const getUser = async () => {
  try {
   const response = await axios.get(`${API_URL}${ENDPOINTS.api.GetUser}`, config);
   return response.data; // Contains username, attributes, etc.
  } catch (error) {
   console.error('Error fetching current user:', error);
   return null;
  }
 };
```

and the `config` looks like this:

```ts
const config = {
 headers: {
  "Content-Type": "application/json",
 },
 withCredentials: true, // Correctly positioned and boolean value
};
```

How can I send the HttpOnly Cookie so that I can use it on the server side?

**Codeium** _at 7:38 pm, Jul 1, 2024_

Based on the information provided and the code snippets from your `src/lib/useAuth.ts` file, the client-side setup for sending the HttpOnly cookie seems correct. The `withCredentials: true` configuration in Axios is intended to include cookies in the request. However, if the cookie is not being sent, the issue might lie in the server-side or client-side configuration related to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).

Here are some possible reasons and solutions:

1. **CORS Configuration on the Server**: For cookies to be included in cross-origin requests, the server must explicitly allow credentials and specify the allowed origin. The `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header should be `true`, and the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` cannot be `*` when credentials are involved. Instead, it must specify the exact origin making the request (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).

2. **Correct Domain and Path**: Ensure that the cookie is set for the correct domain and path from which the requests are made. If the domain or path for the cookie does not match the request domain or path, the cookie will not be included.

3. **Secure and SameSite Attributes**: If the cookie is marked as `Secure`, then the requests need to be made over HTTPS. For local development, this might be an issue if you're serving your site without SSL. The `SameSite` attribute of the cookie can also affect its behavior. For cross-site requests, consider setting this attribute to `None` and `Secure` to make sure the cookie is sent.

Given these points, here are steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

- **Verify Server CORS Configuration**: Ensure that the server (your AWS Lambda function behind API Gateway) is correctly configured for CORS. Check that the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header is set to `true` and that the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header matches the requesting origin exactly.

- **Inspect Set-Cookie Header**: Check the response of the login request to confirm that the `Set-Cookie` header is correctly setting the cookie with appropriate attributes (`Secure`, `SameSite`, `Path`, and `Domain`).

- **HTTPS for Local Development**: If your cookie is `Secure`, you might need to serve your local development environment over HTTPS. Tools like [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) can help you create a local CA for development purposes.

- **Adjust Cookie Attributes**: If you're testing locally or in an environment different from your cookie's domain, consider adjusting the `Domain` and `SameSite` attributes of the cookie for testing purposes.

If these steps do not resolve the issue, providing more details about the server-side configuration, particularly how CORS is configured in your AWS Lambda function or API Gateway, would be helpful.

Let's address each of those.

Item 1 might already be the problem: I have this in `signIn`, `signUp`, and `changePassword` lambda functions:

```ts
  response.headers = {
   "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
   "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials": true,
   "Set-Cookie": setCookieHeader,
  }
```

That already has the problem of `"*"` in `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`.

Can I set it to two domains like I have in my HttpApi?

```ts
   corsPreflight: {
    allowOrigins: ['http://localhost:5173', 'https://handterm.com'],
    allowMethods: [CorsHttpMethod.GET, CorsHttpMethod.POST, CorsHttpMethod.OPTIONS],
    allowHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization'],
    allowCredentials: true,
   },
```

In my `getUser` I don't even have that:

```ts
export const handler = async (event: any) => {
  console.log('getUser received event:', event);
  let response = { statusCode: 401, body: 'Unauthorized', log: 'init\r' };
  try {
    console.log('event.headers: ', event.headers);
    const cookies = event.headers['Cookie'] || event.headers['cookie'];
    console.log('cookies: ', cookies);
    // Parse the cookies to extract needed tokens
    const accessToken = parseCookies(cookies).idToken; // Consider renaming if using an actual access token
    console.log('accessToken: ', accessToken);
    response.log += `accessToken: ${accessToken}\r`;

    // Identify the user from the token and proceed with S3 operations
    // Use the accessToken to get user information from Cognito
    const user = await cognito.getUser({
      AccessToken: accessToken
    }).promise();

    const userId = user.Username;
    console.log('userId: ', userId);
    response.log += `userId: ${userId}\r`;
    // Example S3 operation
    const objectKey = `user_data/${userId}/data.txt`;

    response.log += `objectKey: ${objectKey}\r`;
    const s3Response = await s3.getObject({ Bucket: 'handterm', Key: objectKey }).promise();
    response.log += `s3Response: ${s3Response}\r`;
    console.log('s3Response: ', s3Response);
    // If the file is found, return its content
    const fileContent = s3Response.Body?.toString('utf-8');
    response.log += `fileContent: ${fileContent}\r`;
    console.log('fileContent: ', fileContent);
    response.statusCode = 200;
    response.body = JSON.stringify({ userId: userId, content: fileContent });
    return response;
  } catch (err) {
    response.statusCode = 500;
    return { statusCode: 500, body: JSON.stringify(err) };
  }
}
```

Given your setup and concerns, let's tackle each item systematically:

### Addressing the CORS Configuration for AWS Lambda Functions

Your current configuration in the `signIn`, `signUp`, and `changePassword` Lambda functions uses `"Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*"`, which is not compatible with credentials (cookies) being sent due to the CORS policy. The browser requires an exact match domain in the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header when `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` is set to `true`. Unfortunately, you cannot specify multiple domains in the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header directly in the response from a server (or Lambda function).

### Solution for Handling Multiple Domains

To handle multiple domains, you'll need to implement logic within your Lambda function to check the `Origin` header of the incoming request against a list of allowed origins. Then, dynamically set the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header to match the request's `Origin` if it's within your allowed list. Here's how you could adjust your Lambda function:

```typescript
const allowedOrigins = ['http://localhost:5173', 'https://handterm.com'];

export const handler = async (event: any) => {
  const origin = event.headers.origin;

  let response = {
    statusCode: 200, // Default to 200 unless an error occurs
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials": true
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ message: "Success" }),
  };

  if (allowedOrigins.includes(origin)) {
    response.headers["Access-Control-Allow-Origin"] = origin;
  } else {
    // Optional: Handle the case where the origin is not in the allowed list
    response.statusCode = 403;
    response.body = JSON.stringify({ message: "Origin not allowed" });
    return response;
  }

  // Your existing function logic here...

  return response;
};
```

### Applying CORS Configuration to `getUser`

For your `getUser` function, you should also implement the dynamic `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header setting, as shown above, to ensure that the browser will include cookies in the request.

### Additional Considerations

- Ensure that your client-side code (React application) correctly sends requests with credentials by setting `withCredentials: true` in Axios requests, which you've done.
- Make sure the cookies are set with the correct domain. If you're testing locally and using a production domain, the cookie might not be sent unless the domain matches or is set to a wildcard (which has its own security implications).
- If your API and web application are served from different domains, ensure cookies are set with `SameSite=None; Secure` to allow them to be sent in a cross-origin context. Note that `Secure` requires your sites to be served over HTTPS.

This approach allows your Lambda functions to support requests from multiple origins securely while adhering to CORS policies that permit cookies to be included in requests from allowed origins.

That would be a bunch of code to maintain in multiple Lambda functions.

I know there are features like this pre-signup trigger:

```ts
  // TODO: Remove this before production. This is only to make signup easier during development
  const preSignupLambda = new lambda.Function(this, 'PreSignupLambda', {
   runtime: nodeRuntime,
   handler: 'preSignup.handler',
   code: lambda.Code.fromAsset('lambda/authentication'),
  });
  userPool.addTrigger(cognito.UserPoolOperation.PRE_SIGN_UP, preSignupLambda);
```

Is there anything I can add to my CDK that will handle the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` in one reusable code block?

**Codeium** _at 7:58 pm, Jul 1, 2024_

Yes, you can centralize your CORS configuration and reduce code duplication by leveraging **API Gateway's CORS settings** when you're using API Gateway to set up your HTTP endpoints. This approach allows you to define CORS policies at the API level rather than individually within each Lambda function, making your setup cleaner and easier to maintain.

For an **HTTP API** in AWS CDK, you can configure CORS settings directly on the API gateway. This is done during the creation of the HTTP API. Here's an example based on your scenario:

```typescript
import * as apigatewayv2 from '@aws-cdk/aws-apigatewayv2';
import * as apigatewayv2integrations from '@aws-cdk/aws-apigatewayv2-integrations';
import * as lambda from '@aws-cdk/aws-lambda';
import * as cdk from '@aws-cdk/core';

class MyStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    // Define your Lambda function as usual
    const myLambda = new lambda.Function(this, 'MyFunction', {
      runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_14_X,
      handler: 'index.handler',
      code: lambda.Code.fromAsset('path/to/your/lambda/code'),
    });

    // Create an HTTP API and configure CORS
    const httpApi = new apigatewayv2.HttpApi(this, 'HttpApi', {
      corsPreflight: {
        allowOrigins: ['http://localhost:5173', 'https://handterm.com'],
        allowMethods: [apigatewayv2.CorsHttpMethod.GET, apigatewayv2.CorsHttpMethod.POST, apigatewayv2.CorsHttpMethod.OPTIONS],
        allowHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization'],
        allowCredentials: true,
      },
    });

    // Add routes to the HTTP API
    httpApi.addRoutes({
      path: '/yourApiPath',
      methods: [apigatewayv2.HttpMethod.GET], // Adjust based on your needs
      integration: new apigatewayv2integrations.LambdaProxyIntegration({
        handler: myLambda,
      }),
    });

    // Output the API endpoint
    new cdk.CfnOutput(this, 'HttpApiUrl', {
      value: httpApi.url!,
    });
  }
}

const app = new cdk.App();
new MyStack(app, 'MyStack');
```

This CDK stack snippet does the following:

1. **Defines a Lambda function** that serves as the backend for your HTTP endpoints.
2. **Creates an HTTP API** with CORS preflight configuration that matches your requirements, including allowing credentials and specifying multiple allowed origins.
3. **Adds routes** to the HTTP API that integrate with your Lambda function.

With this setup, CORS is handled at the API Gateway level, so you don't need to include CORS headers manually in your Lambda function responses. This approach not only simplifies your Lambda function code but also centralizes your CORS policy management, making it easier to update if your requirements change.

Remember to replace placeholders like `'path/to/your/lambda/code'` and `'/yourApiPath'` with your actual values.

Does that mean I would remove this from the `signIn` lambda?

```ts
  response.headers = {
   "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
   "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials": true,
   "Set-Cookie": setCookieHeader,
  }
```

I thought you were saying that the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` needs to be dynamically set in each Lambda. Does the `httpApi` setting obviate that?

---

**Codeium** _at 8:02 pm, Jul 1, 2024_

Yes, configuring CORS settings at the API Gateway level as described does mean you can remove the CORS-specific headers (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`) from your individual Lambda functions, including the `signIn` Lambda. The API Gateway's CORS preflight configuration effectively manages these headers for you, simplifying your Lambda function code.

However, it's important to clarify a couple of points:

1. **Centralized CORS Configuration**: When you define CORS settings at the API Gateway level (using `httpApi` in AWS CDK, for instance), API Gateway automatically handles CORS preflight (`OPTIONS`) requests and appends the CORS headers to responses sent to the client. This means you don't need to manually set `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` and `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` headers in your Lambda functions.

2. **Setting Cookies**: While the CORS headers can be managed by API Gateway, you still need to include the `Set-Cookie` header in your Lambda function responses when you want to set cookies in the client's browser. The `Set-Cookie` header is specific to your application's logic (in this case, handling authentication tokens), and it's not part of the CORS policy managed by API Gateway.

So, for your `signIn` Lambda function, you would still return the `Set-Cookie` header as you are but without the CORS-specific headers. Here's a simplified example:

```typescript
response.headers = {
  "Set-Cookie": setCookieHeader,
  // Remove the CORS-specific headers
}
```

This change relies on the fact that API Gateway is configured to handle CORS, as you've set up with `corsPreflight` in your CDK script. This setup ensures that:

- API Gateway manages CORS compliance by automatically adding the necessary CORS headers to responses based on your `corsPreflight` configuration.
- Your Lambda functions focus solely on their business logic and setting any application-specific headers like `Set-Cookie`.

By removing the manual setting of CORS headers in your Lambda functions and relying on API Gateway's CORS configuration, you streamline your code and centralize your CORS policy management, making it easier to maintain and update as needed.

Ok, another thing that may have remained in the code after we changed to HTTP API from REST API is the string concatination of these cookies:

```ts
  const setCookieHeader = [
   `idToken=${IdToken}; Secure; HttpOnly; Path=/`,
   `accessToken=${AccessToken}; Secure; HttpOnly; Path=/`,
   `refreshToken=${RefreshToken}; Secure; HttpOnly; Path=/`
  ].join(', ');
  response.body = JSON.stringify(data.AuthenticationResult);
  response.statusCode = 200;
  response.headers = {
   "Set-Cookie": setCookieHeader,
  }
  return response;
```

I think that HTTP API allows multi-valued cookies? I think that's' why we changed to the HTTP API.

---

**Codeium** _at 8:08 pm, Jul 1, 2024_

Yes, you're correct. One of the reasons for switching from REST API to HTTP API in API Gateway is the native support for multi-value headers, including the `Set-Cookie` header. This feature allows you to return multiple `Set-Cookie` headers in your response without having to join them into a single string, which can improve compatibility with various clients and simplify your response handling.

For HTTP APIs, you can use the `cookies` field in the response object to set multiple cookies directly. Here's how you can adjust your Lambda function to leverage this feature:

```typescript
const response = {
  statusCode: 200,
  body: JSON.stringify(data.AuthenticationResult),
  cookies: [
    `idToken=${IdToken}; Secure; HttpOnly; Path=/`,
    `accessToken=${AccessToken}; Secure; HttpOnly; Path=/`,
    `refreshToken=${RefreshToken}; Secure; HttpOnly; Path=/`
  ]
  // Note: No need to set 'Set-Cookie' in headers manually
};
return response;
```

In this updated approach:

- You directly assign an array of cookie strings to the `cookies` field in the response object. Each string represents a `Set-Cookie` header that the HTTP API will send back to the client.
- There's no need to manually concatenate cookie strings or use the `Set-Cookie` header within the `headers` object. The HTTP API handles the separation and formatting of these cookies for you.

This method ensures that each cookie is correctly handled by the client's browser and conforms to the HTTP specification for setting multiple cookies, avoiding potential issues with string concatenation and parsing on the client side.

Remember, this approach is specific to HTTP APIs in API Gateway and won't work the same way with REST APIs, highlighting one of the advantages of using HTTP APIs for modern web applications.

**User** _at 8:29 pm, Jul 1, 2024_

Ok, but I still don't see the cookies being sent back when I call `getUser`

This is the server log:

```

Given the server log you've shared, it confirms that the request to your `getUser` function does not include cookies in the headers. This issue usually happens due to the browser not sending the cookies with the request, which can be caused by several factors:

1. **CORS and Credentials**: As previously discussed, for browsers to include cookies in requests to a different origin (cross-origin), both the server and the client need to be properly configured to handle credentials. This involves:
   - The server (your AWS Lambda function via API Gateway) must include the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header with the exact requesting origin (not `*`) and the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header with the value `true`.
   - The client (your React app) must send requests with `withCredentials: true`. Since you've already configured this on the client-side, the issue might be on the server-side.

2. **SameSite Cookie Attribute**: If the cookies are set with the `SameSite` attribute as `Strict` or `Lax`, they won't be sent on cross-origin requests. For cookies to be included on cross-origin requests, they need to be set with `SameSite=None; Secure`. The `Secure` attribute requires the cookies to be sent over HTTPS.

3. **API Gateway Configuration**: Ensure that your API Gateway configuration is correctly set to allow credentials and that the deployed version includes these settings. Sometimes changes might not be fully deployed or propagated.

4. **HTTPS Requirement**: As mentioned, cookies marked as `Secure` (which is required when `SameSite=None`) need to be transmitted over HTTPS. Ensure that the request from your client to the server is made over HTTPS, especially given the presence of `x-forwarded-proto: https` in the log, indicating that API Gateway expects HTTPS.

5. **Check Cookie Domain and Path**: Ensure the cookies are set for the correct domain and path that match your `getUser` request. If the domain and path of the cookies don't match the request, the browser won't include them.

6. **Ensure Cookies Are Being Set**: Ensure that the response from your `signIn` (or equivalent login) function actually sets the cookies in the client browser. You can check this by inspecting the browser's developer tools (Application tab in Chrome) to see if the cookies are present and correctly configured.

Since you've transitioned to using HTTP API and are setting cookies in the response, verify that the response from the login endpoint includes the `Set-Cookie` headers correctly and that these cookies are visible in the browser. If the cookies are correctly set and visible in the browser but still not included in requests to `getUser`, revisit the CORS configuration in your HTTP API setup to ensure it matches your domains and credentials requirements accurately.

If after checking these factors the issue persists, you might want to explicitly log the origin and cookies at the API Gateway level or use a tool like AWS CloudWatch to trace the request flow and identify at which point the cookies are being dropped or not included.

**User** _at 8:36 pm, Jul 1, 2024_

Ok, but I really want to narrow this down to very specific checks.

Let's work in the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` by checking each of the existing configurations and the actual calls being made, so any queries or scripts I can run or anything I can copy from the browser or specific settings that can be validated.

Now I cam going to copy what I see in the browser so that you can see exactly what it is doing:

Based on the information from the browser's Dev Tools, it seems there is a missing piece in the headers section related to the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` and `Set-Cookie` headers in the `signIn` response that are crucial for diagnosing the issue. However, based on the situation described, here are specific checks and steps you can take to narrow down and potentially solve the problem:

### 1. Verify `signIn` Response Cookies
First, ensure that the `signIn` response actually sets the cookies in the browser:
- In the browser's Dev Tools, go to the Network tab, find the `signIn` request, and check the Response Headers for `Set-Cookie` entries.
- Ensure that these `Set-Cookie` headers include attributes like `Path=/`, `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and optionally `SameSite=None` if you're making cross-origin requests with credentials.

### 2. Check Browser Cookie Storage
- Still in Dev Tools, go to the Application tab and look under the Cookies section on the left. Check if the cookies set by the `signIn` response are correctly stored for the domain making the request.
- Verify that the domain of the cookies matches your front-end application's domain or is a wildcard (appropriate for your situation).

### 3. CORS Configuration Check on API Gateway
- Ensure the deployed API Gateway configuration for CORS matches your expectations. This can be verified through the AWS Management Console under API Gateway or by reviewing the deployed settings in your infrastructure as code (if using AWS CDK or similar).
- Specifically, check that `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` is set to `true` and `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` is configured with the correct origin(s), not `*`.

### 4. Review HTTP API Deployment
- Sometimes, changes to the API configuration might not be fully deployed. Verify that your latest CORS configuration and any other changes are fully deployed in the API Gateway stage you're testing against.

### 5. Examine the `getUser` Request Headers
- In the Dev Tools Network tab, when you select the failed `getUser` request, check the Request Headers to ensure it includes the `Origin` header. The absence of this header could lead to CORS issues.

### 6. Ensure HTTPS Usage
- Since cookies with the `Secure` attribute require HTTPS, ensure both your `signIn` and `getUser` requests use HTTPS URLs.

### 7. Test with Postman or CURL
- Sometimes, testing the API with tools like Postman or CURL can offer insights. Use these tools to send a request to your `getUser` endpoint, including manually setting the `Cookie` header to mimic a browser request. This can help identify if the issue is with the browser or the server configuration.

If after these checks, the issue persists, consider the following additional steps:

- **Review Lambda Function Logs**: Check the CloudWatch logs for your `getUser` Lambda function for any errors or unexpected behavior.
- **AWS Support**: If you're using AWS professionally, consider opening a support case with AWS Support for direct assistance.

Each of these steps aims to isolate the issue by verifying the configuration at different points in the request/response cycle, from the browser to the AWS infrastructure.

**Codeium** _at 8:39 pm, Jul 1, 2024_

With the `signIn` response headers you've provided, it's clear that the cookies are being set correctly with the necessary attributes (`Secure; HttpOnly; Path=/`). This is a good sign and indicates that the server-side is correctly handling its part for setting cookies. Additionally, `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` and `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:5173` are correctly configured, allowing for credentials (including cookies) to be sent from the specified origin.

Given this setup, let's proceed with specific checks and validations to ensure everything is configured correctly for `getUser` to receive cookies:

### 1. **Verify Cookies are Stored in the Browser**
- Open the browser's Developer Tools, navigate to the Application tab, and look under the Cookies section. Verify that the cookies (`idToken`, `accessToken`, `refreshToken`) are listed there for the domain `x7jzrjfuv8.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`. If you're not seeing the cookies, it means they were not stored correctly, possibly due to domain/path mismatches or other issues.

### 2. **Check Request from the Browser to `getUser`**
- In the Developer Tools, under the Network tab, locate the request to `getUser`. Check the Request Headers to ensure the `Cookie` header is present and includes your `idToken`, `accessToken`, and `refreshToken`. If the `Cookie` header is missing, the browser is not sending the stored cookies, which could be because of the domain, path, or SameSite attributes.

### 3. **Ensure `getUser` has Correct CORS Response**
- Since your `signIn` function includes the correct `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` and `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` headers, ensure your `getUser` function (or the API Gateway configuration for that endpoint) also includes these headers in the response. Without them, the browser will not accept the response if the request includes credentials.

### 4. **Review API Gateway Configuration**
- Double-check your API Gateway configuration for the `getUser` endpoint. Ensure that CORS is configured to allow credentials and the specific origin `http://localhost:5173`. This is crucial for development environments where the client and server are on different origins.

### 5. **Check for HTTPS and SameSite Requirements**
- Ensure that all requests are made over HTTPS, especially since the cookies are set with the `Secure` attribute. For local development, if your site is served over `http` (like `http://localhost:5173`), browsers might block cookies marked as `Secure` from being sent.
- If your cookies are set with `SameSite=None`, which is not visible in the response headers you provided but might be implicitly set or required due to the `Secure` attribute, ensure all requests are made over secure connections.

### 6. **Test Across Different Browsers**
- Test the behavior across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) to see if the issue persists. This can help identify if it's a browser-specific security policy causing the issue.

### 7. **Review Server Logs for `getUser`**
- Check the server logs for the `getUser` function to see if there are any errors or warnings that might indicate why the cookies are not being processed. Given that the request is resulting in a `500 Internal Server Error`, there might be additional information in the logs that could point to the cause of the failure.

Based on the response headers for `signIn`, your server-side setup for setting cookies seems correct. The next step is to ensure that the browser and the `getUser` endpoint are correctly configured to send and receive these cookies, respectively.

**User** _at 8:43 pm, Jul 1, 2024_

In the browser Dev Tools under the Application tab, I only see cookies for `http://localhost:5173`, and they're google cookies begining in `_ga`. One is just `_ga` and the other is longer, but starting with `_ga`

---

**Codeium** _at 8:44 pm, Jul 1, 2024_

Given that you only see Google-related cookies (`_ga`) for `http://localhost:5173` and none related to your application (especially the `idToken`, `accessToken`, `refreshToken` cookies set by the `signIn` function), it appears the cookies set by your `signIn` endpoint are not being stored for the correct domain or are not accessible due to browser security policies. This explains why the cookies are not included in subsequent requests to the `getUser` endpoint.

### Troubleshooting Steps:

#### 1. **Domain and Path of Cookies**
- The cookies set by your `signIn` response are intended for the domain from which the API is served (`x7jzrjfuv8.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`). However, for cookies to be accessible to the client-side application running on `http://localhost:5173`, the cookies need to be associated with a domain that includes `localhost:5173` or be set from the same origin. Since it's not feasible to set cookies for a completely different domain directly (i.e., from your API to the client's localhost), this setup won't work as intended.
  
#### 2. **Consider Using a Proxy During Development**
- To work around this issue during development, consider using a development proxy that allows requests to your API to appear as if they're coming from the same origin. This can be configured in development tools like Webpack Dev Server, Create React App, or directly in your application code if you're using a server. This approach makes the API requests appear to originate from the same domain and port as your local development server, thus avoiding cross-origin issues.

#### 3. **Review the Secure and SameSite Attributes**
- The `Secure` attribute on cookies requires them to be transmitted over HTTPS, which is typically not an issue for deployed applications but can be problematic for local development if not using HTTPS locally. For local testing, you might need to remove the `Secure` attribute, but be sure to reinstate it for production.
- If you've manually set or plan to set the `SameSite` attribute, be cautious with its value. `SameSite=None` requires `Secure`, and `SameSite=Strict` or `Lax` might prevent cookies from being sent on cross-origin requests. For local development without HTTPS, you might need to temporarily remove these attributes.

#### 4. **Test on Deployed Environment**
- Deploy your application and test it in an environment that matches your production setup more closely. For instance, serve your front-end and back-end through the same domain or subdomains and ensure that the scheme is HTTPS. This environment will give you a more accurate representation of how cookies are handled.

#### 5. **Check for Browser-Specific Policies**
- Modern browsers have started to enforce more strict policies around cookies, especially with attributes like `Secure` and `SameSite`. Ensure your browser is not configured to block third-party cookies outright, as this could also be affecting your development testing.

### Conclusion
For local development, setting up a proxy to route API requests through your local development server is a practical approach to avoid cross-origin issues. This will allow you to bypass the problem of cookies not being stored or sent due to cross-origin policies. Additionally, testing in a deployed or staging environment that more closely mirrors your production setup will help identify if the issue is specific to the local development environment.

I have deployed to the production environment and I am still seeing the same problem, no cookies set for the HTTP API domain, only my own web app domain.

So, we seem to have narrowed down the problem to the cookies not being set when `Set-Cookie` is called, is that right? 

And `Set-Cookie` is an operation that the browser must execute?

And the cookie should be visible to me in the Dev Tools App tab under the domain of the AWS-hosted API domain?

What other ways can we test and troubleshoot the narrowly focused problem we are having?

---

**Codeium** _at 6:40 am, Jul 2, 2024_

Given that you've deployed to the production environment and are still encountering the issue where cookies set by the `Set-Cookie` header from your AWS-hosted HTTP API domain aren't being stored for that domain, it's clear the problem revolves around the handling of `Set-Cookie` by the browser. Let's clarify a few points and explore additional troubleshooting steps:

### Understanding `Set-Cookie` and Browser Behavior
- **Browser's Role**: Yes, the `Set-Cookie` operation is executed by the browser. When a server responds with a `Set-Cookie` header, the browser is responsible for storing the cookie and including it in subsequent requests to the same domain, as per the cookie's attributes (e.g., `Domain`, `Path`, `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite`).
- **Visibility in Dev Tools**: Under normal circumstances, cookies set by a server should be visible in the browser's Developer Tools under the Application tab, categorized under the domain that set them. If they're not visible for the AWS-hosted API domain, it indicates they weren't stored by the browser.

### Troubleshooting and Testing Strategies

#### 1. **Examine `Set-Cookie` Header Attributes**
- **Domain Attribute**: Check if the `Set-Cookie` headers from your production environment include a `Domain` attribute. If so, ensure it correctly matches the domain of your AWS-hosted API. Incorrect or absent `Domain` attributes can prevent the browser from storing the cookie.
- **Path Attribute**: Verify the `Path` attribute. If it's too restrictive, the cookie might not be applicable to the resource you're trying to request.
- **Secure and SameSite Attributes**: Ensure that the `Secure` attribute is appropriate for your deployment (i.e., your site is served over HTTPS). For `SameSite`, if it's set to `None`, the `Secure` attribute must be present.

#### 2. **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Configuration**
- Double-check your CORS settings, specifically `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` and `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`. For cookies to be included in cross-origin requests, `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` must be `true`, and `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` cannot be `*`; it must specify the exact requesting origin.

#### 3. **Test with CURL**
- Use CURL to directly call the endpoint setting the cookie to examine the `Set-Cookie` header. This bypasses any browser-specific behavior:
  ```sh
  curl -i https://your-api-endpoint.com/signIn
  ```
  Check the response headers for `Set-Cookie` to confirm the server is correctly setting it.

#### 4. **Review Server-Side Logs**
- Review logs on the server-side to ensure that the `Set-Cookie` headers are being set as expected in your responses. This can help identify if the issue arises before the response reaches the browser.

#### 5. **Browser Console and Network Analysis**
- In the browser's Developer Tools, use the Console and Network tabs to monitor any warnings or errors related to cookies. The Console may display warnings about cookies being blocked due to policy violations.
- The Network tab can provide insights into the response headers for the requests causing issues. Make sure the responses for `signIn` or similar endpoints actually include the `Set-Cookie` headers as expected.

#### 6. **Check Browser Cookie Policies**
- Modern browsers have been updating their policies regarding cookies, particularly around the `SameSite` attribute. Ensure your browser's privacy settings are not interfering with cookie storage, especially third-party cookies if your API is considered third-party in this context.

### Conclusion
If after these steps the cookies are still not being stored or sent, it might be necessary to reconsider the cookie attributes (`Domain`, `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, `Path`, `SameSite`) or the architecture around how your authentication flow is handled, potentially exploring alternative approaches to managing session state or authentication tokens.

The HTTP response you've received indeed shows that the server is attempting to set cookies (`idToken`, `accessToken`, `refreshToken`) with the `Secure` and `HttpOnly` flags. Given this, and the fact that you're still not seeing these cookies under the domain of the AWS-hosted API in the browser's Dev Tools, here are a few areas to consider:

### 1. **Domain and Path of Cookies**
- The `Path=/` attribute means the cookies should be available for the entire domain. However, since there's no explicit `Domain` attribute in the `Set-Cookie` header you provided, the browser defaults to setting these cookies for the exact domain and subdomain from which the response was served. If your front-end and API are served from different subdomains or domains, this could prevent the front-end from accessing these cookies.

### 2. **Secure Attribute**
- The `Secure` flag means the cookies will only be sent over HTTPS. This is a best practice, especially for sensitive tokens like `idToken` and `accessToken`. Ensure your site is accessed via HTTPS in production, as accessing it via HTTP might prevent `Secure` cookies from being sent or stored.

### 3. **HttpOnly Attribute**
- The `HttpOnly` flag prevents JavaScript from accessing these cookies, enhancing security by mitigating XSS attacks. However, this means you won't be able to access or manipulate these cookies using client-side JavaScript; they are only sent automatically with HTTP requests to the server. This does not affect their visibility in the browser's Dev Tools but is important for understanding how they can be used in your application.

### 4. **Browser Policy and Third-Party Cookies**
- Modern browsers have started to block third-party cookies by default under certain conditions, especially if they don't include a `SameSite` attribute or if it's set incorrectly for your use case. Although your cookies are set directly by your API (not technically third-party in the traditional sense), restrictive browser settings or policies could still affect how these cookies are handled.

### Troubleshooting Steps:

1. **Review Browser Settings**: Ensure your browser is not configured to block cookies from the domain of your AWS-hosted API. Also, check for any extensions or settings that might be interfering with cookie storage.

2. **Check the Response Domain**: Confirm the domain or subdomain in your browser's address bar matches the domain for which the cookies should be set. If they differ, the browser may not store or send the cookies as expected.

3. **Inspect Cookies in Different Browsers**: Try accessing your application in a different browser or in incognito/private mode to see if the behavior changes. This can help identify if the issue is related to specific browser settings or extensions.

4. **Consider SameSite Attribute**: Modern best practices recommend setting the `SameSite` attribute for cookies, which controls cross-site and same-site requests with cookies. Lack of a `SameSite` attribute, or setting it to `None` without `Secure`, can cause issues. For cross-origin requests, `SameSite=None; Secure` might be necessary.

5. **Test with a Simplified Path**: As a diagnostic step, try setting and accessing cookies in a more controlled environment. For example, set a simple, non-HttpOnly test cookie from your API and see if it's accessible from your front-end. This can help isolate whether the issue is with the security attributes or other factors.

6. **Server Logs and Configurations**: Verify your server-side configurations to ensure cookies are being set as expected for each response. Additionally, server logs can provide insights into any errors or issues that occur when setting cookies.

Given the details you've provided, the issue seems to be more related to how the browser is handling the cookies rather than them not being set by the server. Addressing the potential discrepancies between the domain serving the page and the domain setting the cookies, alongside ensuring compliance with browser security policies, will be key to resolving this issue.

Ok, so I could roll back some of the security settings in the `Set-Cookie`, at least for the purpose of troubleshooting?

What about also explicitly setting the `Domain=`?

---

**Codeium** _at 7:23 am, Jul 2, 2024_

Yes, for troubleshooting purposes, you can adjust the security settings in the `Set-Cookie` header to see if these changes impact the browser's behavior regarding cookie storage. Here's how you can approach this:

### Reducing Security Attributes Temporarily

1. **Remove the `Secure` Flag**: Temporarily remove the `Secure` flag to allow the cookie to be sent over non-HTTPS connections. This is useful if you're testing on a local environment or any setup not using SSL/TLS encryption. Remember, this is only for testing; production should always use `Secure`.

2. **Remove the `HttpOnly` Flag**: Removing `HttpOnly` allows you to access the cookie via JavaScript, which is not recommended for sensitive tokens but can be useful for debugging. This way, you can manually check if the cookie is being set by using `document.cookie` in the browser's console.

3. **Adjust the `SameSite` Attribute**: If you're working with cross-site requests in your development or testing environment, setting `SameSite=None; Secure` allows the cookie to be sent in cross-site requests. However, for troubleshooting, you might try `SameSite=Lax` or even temporarily remove the attribute to see how the browser handles the cookie.

### Explicitly Setting the `Domain` Attribute

Setting the `Domain` attribute in the `Set-Cookie` header explicitly defines the domain scope where the cookie should be available. This can be particularly useful if your API and the web application are served from the same top-level domain but different subdomains. Here's what to consider:

- **Setting `Domain` for Subdomain Accessibility**: If you want cookies set by `api.example.com` to be accessible on `www.example.com`, you could set `Domain=.example.com` in your `Set-Cookie` header. The leading dot (`.`) before the domain name specifies that the cookie is available to the domain and all its subdomains.

```http
Set-Cookie: idToken=value; Domain=.example.com; Path=/; HttpOnly; Secure;
```

- **Cross-Domain Sharing**: If your setup requires sharing cookies across entirely different domains, the `Domain` attribute won't help, as browsers restrict setting cookies for domains other than the source domain of the request for security reasons. In such cases, you'd need to look into other mechanisms for sharing state, like using web tokens in Authorization headers.

When modifying these attributes, it's crucial to monitor how the changes affect cookie storage and transmission in both development and production environments closely. Tools like the browser's developer console and network inspector are invaluable for observing these changes in real-time.

Remember, these adjustments are primarily for identifying the issue. Any reduction in security, like removing `Secure` or `HttpOnly`, should be reverted once you've pinpointed the problem. Always aim for the highest security standards in your production environment, particularly when handling authentication tokens and session identifiers.

I don't think I am currently setting `SameSite`, so I should just leave that out for now, right?

My website is calling the `signIn` and `getUser` from `handterm.com`, but the AWS Cognito/Lamda HTTP API is at `https://x7jzrjfuv8.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`.

So, I think that means setting an explicit `Domain=` would not help?

---

**Codeium** _at 7:28 am, Jul 2, 2024_

That's correct; in your scenario, setting an explicit `Domain=` attribute in the `Set-Cookie` header wouldn't help, and here's why:

### Cross-Domain Restrictions

The `Domain` attribute in a `Set-Cookie` header is used to specify which hosts can receive a cookie. However, it cannot be used to set a cookie for a domain other than the one that is making the response. In other words, if your AWS Lambda function at `https://x7jzrjfuv8.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com` sets a cookie, it cannot specify `Domain=handterm.com` to make the cookie available to your website's domain due to the same-origin policy enforced by browsers for security reasons. The cookie will inherently be limited to the exact domain from which the response is served unless both are under the same top-level domain with subdomains involved.

### `SameSite` Attribute

Since you mentioned not currently setting the `SameSite` attribute, it's worth understanding its role, especially in contexts involving cross-site requests:

- **`SameSite=Strict`**: The cookie is sent in requests only within the same site the cookie was set.
- **`SameSite=Lax`**: Similar to `Strict`, but the cookie is sent on some cross-site requests, such as when navigating to the site from an external site.
- **`SameSite=None`**: The cookie is sent in requests both within the same site and across sites. This setting requires the `Secure` attribute, meaning the cookie must be sent over HTTPS.

Given your setup where the website (`handterm.com`) and the AWS API (`x7jzrjfuv8.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`) are on entirely different domains, setting `SameSite=None; Secure` would be necessary for the cookies to be included in cross-origin requests. However, since you cannot set a `Domain` attribute to share cookies between these two domains directly, the cookies set by your API will only be available to requests made to your API domain.

### Solutions for Cross-Domain Communication

1. **Explicitly Pass Tokens**: Instead of relying on cookies for storing tokens in cross-domain setups, a common approach is to explicitly pass tokens in the request headers (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer <token>`) for APIs. This method requires securely handling the tokens in your front-end application and appropriately securing your API to accept these tokens.

2. **CORS Configuration**: Ensure your AWS Lambda function's CORS settings are configured to accept requests from your website's domain. This includes setting `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to your site's domain and `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` to `true` if you're attempting to use cookies for same-site requests.

3. **Proxy Requests**: Another strategy to overcome cross-domain issues is to set up a proxy server within the same domain as your web application that forwards requests to your AWS API. This way, cookies set by the proxy are on the same domain as your web application.

Leaving out `SameSite` in your case means the browser will apply its default behavior, which, depending on the browser version, might be treated as `Lax`. Given the cross-origin nature of your setup, explicitly setting `SameSite=None; Secure` for any cookies you wish to be sent in cross-origin requests would be the appropriate action if you were relying on cookies for authentication or session management in a cross-domain context.

Given that you've loosened the constraints on cookies and you're still not seeing them included in requests to `getUser`, let's review potential reasons and steps that could help diagnose the issue further:

### 1. **Browser-to-Server Cookie Transmission**
Firstly, ensure that the cookies are indeed being set in the browser where you're making the request from. Even if the server sets cookies correctly, if the browser doesn't store them or doesn't send them in subsequent requests, they won't appear in server logs.

- **Check Browser Cookies**: In your browser's developer tools, go to the Application (or Storage) tab and check the cookies for both domains (`localhost` for your local development environment and `x7jzrjfuv8.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com` for your API). Confirm whether the cookies are present and if their attributes (Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite) allow them to be sent to your API.

### 2. **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**
Even with the appropriate `SameSite=None; Secure` settings, cross-origin policies could affect how cookies are handled in requests from your site to the API.

- **CORS Configuration**: Ensure your AWS setup includes the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` header in responses, and that the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header matches the requesting domain exactly. Note that for credentials to be included, `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` cannot be `*`; it must specify the requesting domain explicitly.

### 3. **Local Development Environment**
When testing locally (e.g., `localhost`), there are a few additional considerations:

- **HTTPS vs. HTTP**: If your local environment is served over `http` (as suggested by the log `origin: 'http://localhost:5173'`), but the cookies are set with the `Secure` flag, the browser will not send these cookies to an HTTP site. You might need to test over HTTPS locally or temporarily remove the `Secure` flag for local testing purposes.
- **Port Differences**: Different ports on the same domain are treated as different origins by CORS policies. If your API is expecting to validate a specific origin, ensure the port number is considered.

### 4. **Explicitly Check Request Headers**
Make sure that your client-side application is configured to send credentials (which include cookies) with requests. For instance, if you're using `fetch` to make the request, you need to include credentials in the request configuration:

```javascript
fetch(url, {
  method: 'GET', // or 'POST'
  credentials: 'include', // Necessary to include cookies in requests
  // other settings...
})
```

### Troubleshooting Steps:

1. **Verify Cookie Presence and Attributes in the Browser**: Confirm that the cookies are correctly stored in your browser and inspect their attributes to ensure they're configured to be sent to your API domain.

2. **Review and Adjust CORS Settings**: Double-check your AWS Lambda function's CORS settings, specifically looking at `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` and `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`.

3. **Ensure Client-Side Request Configuration Includes Credentials**: Confirm that your requests from the client-side application are configured to include credentials.

4. **Consider Environment and Protocol Discrepancies**: Ensure your testing environment (protocol, domain, port) aligns with the cookies' security attributes and CORS configurations.

5. **Server-Side Logging**: On the server side, log the entire request context, not just headers, to confirm whether cookies are being parsed but not logged as expected. This might reveal additional insights.

By systematically checking each of these areas, you should be able to identify why cookies aren't appearing in your `getUser` server logs and make the necessary adjustments.

What about this? This is from the browser dev tools `signIn` request/response.

the top is the request and it has the AWS "Request URL", but under response headers it says "Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:5173"

The information you've provided from the browser dev tools for the `signIn` request and response gives us some valuable insights:

1. **CORS Configuration Appears Correct**: The `Response Headers` include `"Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:5173"`, which indicates that the CORS policy on your AWS Lambda function is correctly configured to allow requests from your local development environment (`http://localhost:5173`). This is a good sign and confirms part of the CORS setup is as expected.

2. **Successful `signIn` Operation**: The `signIn` request is completing successfully with a `200 OK` status, meaning the server is correctly processing the request and the client (your browser) is allowed to communicate with the server. The presence of tokens in the response (`AccessToken`, `RefreshToken`, `IdToken`) further confirms successful authentication.

3. **Error on Subsequent `getUser` Request**: The console errors indicate an attempt to fetch data using `/getUser` results in a `500 (Internal Server Error)`. This suggests the issue might not be directly related to CORS or cookies but rather to how the server handles the `/getUser` request.

Given that CORS and authentication seem to work for the `signIn` request, the cookies (if properly set during the `signIn` response) should, in theory, be available for subsequent requests, assuming the client is configured to send them with credentials. However, the `500` error on the `getUser` request points to a server-side issue when handling that specific endpoint.

### Steps to Troubleshoot:

- **Verify Server-Side Logic for `/getUser`**: Review the AWS Lambda function handling the `/getUser` endpoint. Ensure it's correctly parsing the request, including any cookies or authorization headers, and that there's no internal logic causing the `500` error.
  
- **Check Lambda Function Logs**: Look into the CloudWatch logs for the `/getUser` Lambda function. These logs can provide specific error messages or stack traces that led to the `500` error, offering clues on what needs fixing.

- **Confirm Cookie Handling and Authorization**: If `/getUser` relies on session cookies or tokens for identifying the user, ensure the client-side request to `/getUser` includes these credentials. Even though the `signIn` response includes tokens, you need to confirm that:
  
  - The tokens are stored correctly in the browser (either as cookies or in local storage/session storage).
  - Subsequent requests to `/getUser` include these tokens for authorization. If using cookies, ensure `credentials: 'include'` is set in the request configuration. If using tokens in headers, ensure the `Authorization` header is correctly set.

- **Review API Gateway Configuration**: Ensure that the API Gateway configuration for the `/getUser` endpoint is correctly set up to handle requests, including any authentication and authorization mechanisms you've implemented.

The key takeaway is that the initial `signIn` process seems to work correctly, so the focus should shift to examining how `/getUser` is implemented on the server and ensuring that requests to it are correctly authorized and executed.

Why would I focus on `getUser` server-side parsing of the cookies if we can see that the browser is not storing or sending the cookies?

This path seems to be loosely-focused or even misleading, unless you have reason to believe that the cookies are actually arriving at the server during the `getUser` request.

I would rather be tightly focused on the actual problem at hand, which is that the `Set-Cookie` is not setting the cookie in the browser, is not visible in Dev Tools Application Cookies tab, and is, therefore, _not_ being sent to the server during the `getUser` request. 

We don't need to worry about how the `getUser` funciton parses the cookie, if there is no cookie. Just to reiterate, it can't parse a cookie that doesn't exist.

Unless I am overlooking something. Do you think that the cookie might actually be saved even though it doesn't show up in the browser Dev Tools?

Or, do you think the cookie might actually be being sent even though it doesn't show up in the `getUser` request in the Dev Tools?

Or do you think it is arriving in the `getUser` event headers and just not be logged out when the `console.log(event.headers)` is called?

Here is the Dev Tools `getUser` request:

You're correct in focusing on the core issue that the `Set-Cookie` directive isn't effectively setting the cookie in the browser, as evidenced by its absence in the browser's Dev Tools under the Application/Cookies tab. If the cookie does not appear there, it is indeed not being stored by the browser, and consequently, it won't be sent in subsequent requests to the server, including the `getUser` request.

Given this clarification and focusing strictly on why the `Set-Cookie` header might not lead to the browser storing the cookie:

### Common Reasons Why `Set-Cookie` Might Not Work:

1. **Incorrect Domain/Path**: The cookie needs to be scoped correctly to be sent with requests. Since the API and the web client are on different domains, the `Domain` attribute in `Set-Cookie` cannot be used to bridge this gap due to same-origin policy restrictions.

2. **Secure Flag with HTTP**: If the `Secure` flag is set in the `Set-Cookie` header, the cookie will only be sent over HTTPS. Since your origin log shows `http://localhost:5173`, ensure your local development environment is accessed over HTTPS if the `Secure` flag is used, or remove the `Secure` flag for local testing.

3. **SameSite Policy**: Modern browsers default the `SameSite` attribute to `Lax` if not specified. For cookies to be sent in a cross-origin request, `SameSite=None; Secure` must be explicitly set, especially if your API and client are on different domains or schemes (http vs https).

4. **Cookie Attributes Mismatch**: Other attributes in the `Set-Cookie` header, such as `Expires` or `Max-Age`, might cause the browser to immediately expire the cookie or not store it at all if they're incorrectly set.

5. **Browser Settings**: Browser settings or extensions that block third-party cookies could prevent the cookie from being stored, especially in cross-origin scenarios.

6. **Response Not Viewed by the Browser as Legitimate**: If there's a problem with the SSL certificate (when accessed over HTTPS), or if the browser detects any security issues with the response, it might refuse to store the cookie.

### Verifying the Cookie Issue:

- **Check the Full Response Headers in Dev Tools**: Ensure that the `Set-Cookie` header is present in the network response for the `signIn` request and inspect its attributes closely.

- **Test with a Simple Cookie**: Try setting a simple, minimal cookie (e.g., `Set-Cookie: test=1; Path=/;`) in the `signIn` response to see if it's stored. This can help determine if the issue is with the cookie attributes or the broader server-client setup.

- **Cross-Origin vs Same-Origin**: As a diagnostic step, you might set up a simple endpoint on the same domain as your client and see if cookies set by this endpoint are stored and sent. This can help isolate whether the issue is specifically related to cross-origin behavior.

- **Consider Network Conditions**: Ensure there's no network proxy or security software that might strip specific headers from the response before they reach the browser.

Given the information, focusing on ensuring that your local environment can handle HTTPS (if using the `Secure` flag) and verifying the cookie's attributes (especially `Secure` and `SameSite`) are correctly configured for your cross-origin setup is essential. If these are correctly set and the problem persists, reviewing browser-specific behaviors or restrictions that might affect cookie storage would be the next step.
