I want to exit a function if the current user is not logged in, but the `getUser()` is async.

I have:

```ts
  if(!(await this.props.auth.getUser())) return false;
```

what am I doing wrong? Actually, what is the best way to do this?

To properly handle asynchronous operations like `await` within a function, the function itself must be declared as `async`. This allows you to use `await` to wait for promises to resolve inside the function. From the snippet you've shared, it looks like you're trying to use `await` without the function being declared as `async`.

If the function you're trying to add this logic to is not an `async` function, you will encounter syntax errors or unexpected behavior because `await` can only be used inside `async` functions.

Given the context and your description, here's how you can modify your function to properly handle the asynchronous `getUser` method:

1. Declare your function as `async` if it's not already. This will allow you to use `await` within the function.
2. Use the `await` keyword before `this.props.auth.getUser()` to wait for the promise to resolve.
3. Based on the resolved value, you can then decide whether to exit the function or continue executing the rest of the code.

Here's an example restructuring based on the common usage pattern in a React component:

```tsx
async someFunction() {
  // Assuming this.props.auth.getUser() is an async function and returns null or user object
  if (!(await this.props.auth.getUser())) {
    console.log('User not logged in, exiting function');
    return false; // Exit the function if no user is logged in
  }

  // Continue with the function if user is logged in
  console.log('User is logged in, continuing execution');
  // Rest of your code goes here
}
```

Remember, if this method is an event handler or tied to a lifecycle method in a class component, making it `async` could have implications on how you handle the event or lifecycle operation, since the method will now return a promise. Always ensure the async behavior is compatible with how the function is being used within your component.

If the function you're modifying is part of a larger flow that cannot be made asynchronous for some reason, you'll need to use promise syntax with `.then()` and `.catch()` to handle the asynchronous operation without `await`. However, based on your scenario, converting the function to `async` and using `await` seems to be the straightforward approach.

The function being called is declared as async, but it is in another module in a React project.

```ts
 const getUser = async () => {
  try {
   // Make the request with the Access Token
   const response = await axios.get(`${API_URL}${ENDPOINTS.api.GetUser}`, getAuthConfig());
   return response.data; // Contains username, attributes, etc.
  } catch (error) {
   console.error('Error fetching current user:', error);
   return null;
  }
 };
```

It's exported like this:

```ts
 return { isLoggedIn, login: signIn, logout: signOut, signUp, refreshSession, getUser, checkSession, changePassword, setUser, saveLog, getLog, listLog };
```

And it is imported as a `prop` in the module it is being called from:

```ts
export interface IHandTermProps {
 // Define the interface for your HandexTerm logic
 terminalWidth: number;
 auth: {
  login: (username: string, password: string, callback: (error: any, result: any) => void) => void;
  logout: () => void;
  isLoggedIn: boolean;
  signUp: (
   username: string,
   password: string,
   email: string,
   callback: (error: any, result: any) => void
  ) => void;
  getUser: () => any;
  setUser: (profile: string) => void;
  saveLog: (key: string, content: string) => void;
  changePassword: (
   oldPassword: string,
   newPassword: string,
   callback: (error: any, result: any) => void
  ) => void;
  // Add other properties returned by useAuth here
 };
}
```

Given your setup and the details provided, it seems like you are correctly defining and importing the `getUser` function. However, the issue arises in how you're trying to use this function within a context that requires synchronous execution, specifically when you're checking if the user is logged in and wish to exit the function immediately if not.

The correct approach would be to ensure that any function calling `await this.props.auth.getUser()` itself must be an `async` function. Since you're using this within a class component, it's important to remember that React lifecycle methods (like `render`, `componentDidMount`, etc.) cannot be marked as `async` because React expects these methods to return specific types of values synchronously.

If you're calling `this.props.auth.getUser()` from a custom method within your class component, you can make that method `async` and use `await` as you've shown. Here's an example modification to fit your scenario:

```tsx
// Assuming this is a method within your React class component
async checkUserAndDoSomething() {
  if (!(await this.props.auth.getUser())) {
    console.log('No user logged in, exiting...');
    return false;
  }

  // User is logged in, proceed with the rest of the function
  console.log('User is logged in, continuing...');
  // The rest of your code here
}
```

Remember, calling this `async` method won't directly affect the rendering logic since `async` functions return a Promise. If you are trying to conditionally render something based on whether the user is logged in, you should manage this state (`isLoggedIn`) within your component's state and use `componentDidMount` or `useEffect` (in functional components) to set this state once the user data is fetched. Here’s a quick example of how you might initiate this check in a class component's lifecycle method and update the component's state accordingly:

```tsx
componentDidMount() {
  this.checkUserAndDoSomething().then(isLoggedIn => {
    if (isLoggedIn) {
      // Update the component state or perform actions based on user being logged in
    }
  });
}
```

This ensures that your component properly handles the asynchronous nature of fetching user data while maintaining compatibility with React's lifecycle expectations.
