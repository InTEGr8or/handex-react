I need your help reviewing my AWS CDK stack.

I want the user to be able to signup and log in, and once they log in, HttpOnly Cookies should be used to validate the user and allow them to read and write to S3.

Your AWS CDK stack for setting up a serverless infrastructure that supports user signup, login, and secure access to S3 resources using HttpOnly cookies for session validation looks well-structured and comprehensive. Here's a review that covers some key aspects:

### Cognito for Authentication
- **User Pool Creation**: You've configured a Cognito User Pool with email-based signup and verification, which is a common practice for many applications. The setup for self-signup and the email verification process is correctly implemented.
- **Pre-Signup Lambda Trigger**: The pre-signup Lambda trigger for development purposes is a good strategy to manipulate or validate user data before the signup process completes.
- **User Pool Client**: The configuration enables both SRP and password-based authentication flows. This flexibility is beneficial, but ensure that your client application supports these flows.

### API Gateway and Lambda Integrations
- **API Gateway**: You've correctly set up an HTTP API with CORS enabled, which is essential for a web application to interact with the API.
- **Lambda Functions for Authentication**: The setup for `signUpLambda`, `signInLambda`, `changePasswordLambda`, and `getUserLambda` functions with their respective integrations and routes is correctly done.
- **Lambda Execution Role**: The role granting Lambda functions access to S3 and basic execution permissions is appropriately configured.
- **Authorizer**: Using a `HttpUserPoolAuthorizer` for routes that require authentication is a good practice to secure your API endpoints.

### S3 Bucket for User Logs
- The S3 bucket configuration with block public access and encryption enabled is a secure setup for storing sensitive user data.

### HttpOnly Cookies
- While your code snippet does not directly show the implementation of setting HttpOnly cookies, you mentioned its use for session validation. Ensure that your authentication-related Lambda functions set these cookies correctly in the response headers when users sign in. Refer to the documentation or the code snippets provided in your project guidelines for setting cookies securely.

### Suggestions for Improvement
1. **Post-Authentication Lambda Trigger**: Consider adding a post-authentication Lambda trigger in your Cognito User Pool to handle custom logic after authentication, such as logging or custom token generation.
2. **Fine-Grained IAM Roles**: Instead of granting `AmazonS3FullAccess`, consider specifying only the necessary permissions for your Lambda functions to interact with the S3 bucket. This follows the principle of least privilege.
3. **Environment Variables**: Ensure sensitive information, like the Cognito App Client ID, is securely managed. Your current implementation is fine, but always review and minimize exposure of sensitive data.
4. **Secure Cookie Attributes**: When setting HttpOnly cookies, also use the `Secure` attribute to ensure cookies are sent over HTTPS, and consider the `SameSite` attribute to mitigate CSRF attacks.

### Final Note
Before moving to production, remove the pre-signup Lambda trigger used for development purposes and review all IAM policies and environment configurations for security best practices. Also, test the end-to-end flow, especially the part where HttpOnly cookies are set and used for session management, as this involves both backend and frontend handling.

Considering that, I need to troubleshoot my `signIn`.

  }
```

A `401 Unauthorized` error indicates that the request has not been applied because it lacks valid authentication credentials for the target resource. There are several potential reasons for this error in the context of your `signIn` function:

### 1. Incorrect Credentials
Ensure the credentials provided by the user are correct. Since the error is from the `signIn` function, it's likely an issue with how the credentials are being validated against AWS Cognito.

### 2. Cognito User Pool Client Configuration
Verify that your user pool client (`userPoolClient` in your CDK stack) is correctly configured. Specifically, check if:
- The client is enabled for the authentication flow you're using.
- The client secret (if used) is correctly handled in your `signIn` function. If `generateSecret` is `true`, ensure your backend is using this secret when validating credentials.

### 3. Cognito User Pool Configuration
Ensure the user pool is correctly set up to handle sign-in requests. This includes verifying that the user pool ID matches what your backend expects and that the user pool is in the same region as your Lambda function.

### 4. API Gateway Configuration
Verify that the API Gateway endpoint for your `signIn` function is correctly configured. This includes checking:
- The integration between API Gateway and the Lambda function.
- The deployment of the API Gateway stage.
- CORS configuration, although this typically results in a different error (CORS errors), not a `401 Unauthorized`.

### 5. Token Handling
If the `signIn` Lambda function is supposed to generate tokens (ID, access, and refresh tokens) upon successful authentication, ensure that:
- Tokens are correctly generated and returned in the response.
- HttpOnly cookies are correctly configured in the response headers.

### 6. Debugging the Lambda Function
Since your CDK stack seems correctly set up to handle `signIn` operations, the issue might lie in the Lambda function's logic. Consider adding detailed logging within your Lambda function to capture:
- The incoming request details.
- Any errors or exceptions thrown during the authentication process.

You can use AWS CloudWatch Logs to review these logs. This can provide insights into whether the request reaches your Lambda function and if there are any issues within the function itself.

### 7. Frontend Request
Ensure that the request from the frontend (as seen in `useAuth.ts`) is correctly formatted and sends the necessary headers and payload. A common issue could be:
- Incorrect endpoint URL (notice the triple slashes in the URL `https://x7jzrjfuv8.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com///signIn`; it should probably be a single slash).
- Missing or incorrect headers, especially if content-type or authentication headers are required.

### Debugging Tips
- **Check CloudWatch Logs**: Look for any error messages or stack traces logged by your `signIn` Lambda function.
- **Test Locally Using Postman or AWS CLI**: Try to invoke your `signIn` Lambda function directly using AWS CLI or test the API Gateway endpoint using Postman with the same request payload and headers.
- **Ensure User is Confirmed**: If using AWS Cognito, confirm that the user status is `CONFIRMED` and not pending any verification steps.

By systematically checking these areas, you should be able to identify and resolve the cause of the `401 Unauthorized` error.

**User** _at 1:26 pm, Jul 1, 2024_

I fixed the tripple slash problem.

The issue is that I am getting this error

```
{message: "Unauthorized"}
message
: 
"Unauthorized"
```

But I don't see any path in my `signUp` that can return that:

```ts
// cdk/lambda/authentication/signIn.ts
import * as AWS from 'aws-sdk';
const cognito = new AWS.CognitoIdentityServiceProvider({ region: 'us-east-1' });
exports.handler = async (event: { body: string }) => {
 const body = typeof event.body === 'string' ? JSON.parse(event.body) : event.body;
 console.log('SignIn body:', body);
 let response = {statusCode: 400, headers: {}, body: '', log: new Array<string>()};
 try {
  const { username, password } = body;
  // Ensure ClientId is a string and not undefined
  const clientId = process.env.COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_ID;
  response.log.push(`ClientId: ${clientId}`);
  if (!clientId) {
   throw new Error('COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_ID environment variable is not set.');
  }
  const params = {
   AuthFlow: 'USER_PASSWORD_AUTH',
   ClientId: clientId,
   AuthParameters: {
    USERNAME: username,
    PASSWORD: password,
   },
  };
  body.params = params;
  const data = await cognito.initiateAuth(params).promise();

  console.log('SignIn success:', JSON.stringify(data));

  const { IdToken, AccessToken, RefreshToken } = data.AuthenticationResult ?? {};

  if (!IdToken || !AccessToken || !RefreshToken) {
   // Handle the missing tokens scenario, perhaps by throwing an error or returning an error response
   return {
    statusCode: 400,
    body: JSON.stringify({ message: "Authentication failed or incomplete." }),
   };
  }

  // Concatenate the Set-Cookie strings into a single header value
  const setCookieHeader = [
   `idToken=${IdToken}; Secure; HttpOnly; Path=/`,
   `accessToken=${AccessToken}; Secure; HttpOnly; Path=/`,
   `refreshToken=${RefreshToken}; Secure; HttpOnly; Path=/`
  ].join(', ');
  response.body = JSON.stringify(data.AuthenticationResult);
  response.statusCode = 200;
  response.headers = {
   "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
   "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials": true,
   "Set-Cookie": setCookieHeader,
  }
  return response;
 } catch (err: any) {
  console.error('SignIn error:', err);
  response.statusCode = 400;
  response.headers = {
   "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
   "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials": true,
  };
  response.body = JSON.stringify(err.message);
  response.log.push(err.message);

  return response;
 }
};
```

I am having some trouble with the log groups in the AWS console because it says the log group associated with the `signIn` Lambda does not exist, when I click the link of the associated log in the `signIn` lambda page, which I've refreshed many times.

**Codeium** _at 1:26 pm, Jul 1, 2024_

The error message `{message: "Unauthorized"}` with no clear path in your `signIn` Lambda function to return such a message suggests a few possible issues:

### 1. API Gateway/Lambda Integration Issue
If the Lambda execution role does not have the correct permissions, or if there's an issue with how API Gateway is set up to invoke your Lambda, it could result in an "Unauthorized" response before your Lambda code is even executed.

### 2. API Gateway Authorizer
Check if there's an authorizer configured at the API Gateway level that precedes the Lambda function execution. Since the message is quite generic, it could be coming from an API Gateway authorizer that's failing before reaching your Lambda.

### 3. Environment Variable Misconfiguration
Since your Lambda relies on the `COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_ID` environment variable, ensure it's correctly set in the Lambda configuration. However, this would likely result in a different error message than "Unauthorized," based on your code.

### Troubleshooting Steps:
- **Lambda Permissions:** Ensure that the execution role associated with your Lambda function has the `AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole` policy attached, allowing it to create and write to CloudWatch Logs.
- **Check API Gateway Configuration:** Verify that there are no authorizers set up at the API level that might be rejecting the request before it reaches your Lambda.
- **Manual Invocation:** Try invoking the Lambda function manually through the AWS CLI or the AWS Management Console with a test event to see if the issue persists. This can help isolate the problem to either the Lambda function itself or the way API Gateway is configured.
- **CloudWatch Logs Issue:** The fact that you're having trouble accessing the log group indicates a permissions issue or a misconfiguration. Ensure that:
  - The Lambda function's execution role has permissions to create and write to CloudWatch Logs.
  (Here's a permission snippet to include in your execution role, replace `"Resource": "arn:aws:logs:*:*:*"` with a more specific ARN for tighter security.)
  ```json
  {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
      "logs:CreateLogGroup",
      "logs:CreateLogStream",
      "logs:PutLogEvents"
    ],
    "Resource": "arn:aws:logs:*:*:*"
  }
  ```
  - There's no delay or issue within CloudWatch itself. Sometimes, log groups take a bit of time to show up after the first invocation. If it's a new function or hasn't been invoked before, try invoking it a few times and wait a few minutes.
  - Manually create the log group in CloudWatch Logs with the expected name (`/aws/lambda/your-lambda-function-name`) and retry the operation. This can help identify if the problem is due to permissions to create the log group or put log events.

If after these steps the issue still persists, consider checking any other middleware or configurations in your setup that might be intercepting the request and returning an unauthorized response before your Lambda function executes.

**User** _at 1:41 pm, Jul 1, 2024_

OK, you were right that the log was not showing up becuase the end-point was never hit, which generated zero log items.

I invoked the lambda function in the web UI and now there is a log item.

So the problem seems to be a relatively simple issue of tracking down the API URL path associated with the `signIn` lambda function and figuring out why my client side code is trying to go somewhere else.

Can you help me use AWS CLI tools to find the API `signIn` endpoint URL so that I can compare it to where my client-side code is trying to invoke it?

---

**Codeium** _at 1:41 pm, Jul 1, 2024_

Absolutely, to find the API Gateway endpoint URL for your `signIn` function using the AWS CLI, you'll need to follow a few steps. These steps involve identifying your API Gateway's ID and then constructing the URL based on that ID and the region.

1. **List Your APIs**:
   First, list all the APIs in your account to find the ID of the API Gateway you're interested in. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```sh
   aws apigatewayv2 get-apis
   ```

   This command will return a list of APIs, including their names, IDs, and other information. Look for the `apiId` of the API named `HandTermService` (or whatever name you've given to your HTTP API).

2. **Get API Gateway Endpoint**:
   Once you have the `apiId`, you can construct the endpoint URL. The URL format for HTTP APIs is generally:

   ```
   https://{apiId}.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com
   ```

   Replace `{apiId}` with your actual API Gateway ID and `{region}` with the AWS region your API is deployed in (for instance, `us-east-1`).

3. **Identify the Route**:
   To find the exact route for the `signIn` function, you'll need to list the routes associated with your API Gateway. You can do this by running:

   ```sh
   aws apigatewayv2 get-routes --api-id YOUR_API_ID
   ```

   Replace `YOUR_API_ID` with your actual API Gateway ID. Look for the route with the `signIn` operation. The output will show you the path (e.g., `/signIn`).

4. **Construct the Full URL**:
   Combine the API Gateway endpoint with the route path to get the full endpoint URL for your `signIn` function. For example:

   ```
   https://x7jzrjfuv8.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/signIn
   ```

5. **Compare with Client-Side Code**:
   Finally, compare this URL with the one you're using in your client-side code (in the `useAuth.ts` file or wherever you're making the API call). Ensure the path and HTTP method (POST) match exactly what's configured in API Gateway.

If there are discrepancies, adjust your client-side code to match the correct endpoint URL and route. This should resolve any issues with the API not being hit and ensure that your Lambda function is invoked as expected.

Remember, if you're working with stages in API Gateway, you might also need to include the stage in your URL (e.g., `https://x7jzrjfuv8.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/signIn` for a stage named `prod`).

**User** _at 1:49 pm, Jul 1, 2024_

Great! When I compare these two:

```yml
- ApiKeyRequired: false
  AuthorizationScopes: []
  AuthorizationType: NONE
  RequestModels: {}
  RouteId: 68t92c2
  RouteKey: POST /signUp
  Target: integrations/m4avvik
 - ApiKeyRequired: false
  AuthorizationScopes: []
  AuthorizationType: JWT
  AuthorizerId: 508kry
  RequestModels: {}
  RouteId: 6l5gwm3
  RouteKey: POST /signIn
  Target: integrations/cuzb48j
```

I see that one has an authorization type of `NONE` while the other is `JWT`

Maybe I should remove the authorizer?

```ts
  const signInLambda = new lambda.Function(this, 'SignInFunction', {
   runtime: nodeRuntime,
   handler: 'signIn.handler',
   role: lambdaExecutionRole,
   code: lambda.Code.fromAsset('lambda/authentication'),
   environment: {
    COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_ID: userPoolClient.userPoolClientId,
   }
  });
  httpApi.addRoutes({
   path: ENDPOINTS.api.SignIn,
   methods: [HttpMethod.POST],
   authorizer: cognitoAuthorizer,
   integration: new HttpLambdaIntegration(
    'post-user-signin',
    signInLambda
   ),
  })
```

**Codeium** _at 1:50 pm, Jul 1, 2024_

Yes, based on the information you've provided, it seems your `/signIn` endpoint is configured with a JWT authorizer, which means any request to this endpoint must include a valid JWT token in the authorization header. This setup is typically used for endpoints that require the user to be authenticated before accessing them. However, for a `/signIn` endpoint where users are attempting to authenticate themselves to receive a token, having an authorizer enabled can indeed be problematic because users won't have a token to provide yet.

To allow users to sign in without needing a token, you should remove the authorizer from the `/signIn` route. This will make the endpoint publicly accessible, which is the intended behavior for user authentication endpoints.

Here's how you can modify your CDK code to remove the authorizer for the `/signIn` endpoint:

```ts
  const signInLambda = new lambda.Function(this, 'SignInFunction', {
   runtime: nodeRuntime,
   handler: 'signIn.handler',
   role: lambdaExecutionRole,
   code: lambda.Code.fromAsset('lambda/authentication'),
   environment: {
    COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_ID: userPoolClient.userPoolClientId,
   }
  });
  httpApi.addRoutes({
   path: ENDPOINTS.api.SignIn,
   methods: [HttpMethod.POST],
   // Remove the authorizer from this line
   integration: new HttpLambdaIntegration(
    'post-user-signin',
    signInLambda
   ),
  })
```

By removing the `authorizer: cognitoAuthorizer,` line, you ensure that the `/signIn` endpoint does not require an authorizer, allowing users to sign in without providing a JWT token.

After making this change, deploy your CDK stack again to apply the updates. You can do this using the AWS CDK CLI with the command `cdk deploy`.

This should resolve the issue and allow your client-side code to call the `/signIn` endpoint without encountering an "Unauthorized" error due to missing or invalid JWT tokens.

Ok, `signIn` now works.

I get an `HttpOnly` secure cookie called `idToken`. 

It has a domain of `x7jzrjfuv8.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`

But when I try to call `getUser` it says 

```
useAuth.ts?t=1719865124383:36   
GET https://x7jzrjfuv8.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/getUser 401 (Unauthorized)

```

The `401 (Unauthorized)` error when calling your `getUser` endpoint, despite having successfully signed in and received an `HttpOnly` secure cookie called `idToken`, suggests that the `getUser` endpoint is either not receiving the cookie or is unable to correctly process it. Here are several areas to check and ways to troubleshoot this issue:

### 1. **Ensure Cookies are Sent with Requests**
- Since you're using `HttpOnly` cookies, the browser should automatically send the cookie with subsequent requests to the same domain. However, ensure that your client-side code, when calling `getUser`, is not inadvertently omitting cookies. With Axios, for instance, you should ensure `withCredentials: true` is set for the request. This is crucial for cross-origin requests.

### 2. **Verify API Gateway Configuration**
- Ensure that the `getUser` endpoint in your API Gateway is configured to allow credentials. CORS settings should include `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` and the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header must not be `*` when credentials are supported. Instead, it should specify the exact origin of your client application.

### 3. **Check the Authorizer Configuration for getUser**
- If your `getUser` endpoint is protected by an authorizer (e.g., a JWT authorizer), ensure that it's correctly configured to validate the `idToken` you're receiving. This includes verifying that the authorizer is set up to use the correct User Pool information and is looking for tokens in the right place (headers or cookies).

### 4. **Domain and Path of the Cookie**
- The domain of the cookie `x7jzrjfuv8.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com` might cause issues if your client application is hosted on a different domain. Cookies will only be sent if the request is made to the same domain (and subdomain, depending on the cookie's domain attribute) from which the cookie was set.
- Similarly, ensure the path for which the cookie is set (`Path=/`) matches or encompasses the path of your API calls.

### 5. **Inspect the Cookie in Browser Developer Tools**
- Use the browser's developer tools to inspect the cookies being stored for your domain. Confirm that the `idToken` cookie is present and its attributes (Secure, HttpOnly, Domain, Path) are correctly set to be included in the request to your `getUser` endpoint.
- Also, check the request headers in the developer tools' network tab to see if the `Cookie` header is included in the request to `getUser`.

### Troubleshooting Steps:
- **Directly Invoke `getUser` with Postman or Curl**: Try to directly invoke the `getUser` endpoint using a tool like Postman or curl, manually including the `idToken` cookie in the request. This can help determine if the issue is with the API configuration or the way the client application is sending requests.
- **Review Lambda Logs**: Check the CloudWatch logs for your `getUser` Lambda function to see if it's being invoked and if there are any errors or warning messages that might indicate why the request is unauthorized.

If these checks do not resolve the issue, consider providing more details about how the `getUser` endpoint is configured, including any authorizer settings and the Lambda function code, for further diagnosis.

I think I am supposed to set some CORS settings either on my Cognito resource or my HTTP API resource in my CDK.

**Codeium** _at 2:17 pm, Jul 1, 2024_

The error you're encountering is a CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issue. It occurs because your frontend application hosted at `http://localhost:5173` is trying to access resources on a different origin (`https://x7jzrjfuv8.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`), and the server does not include the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header in its response to the preflight request sent by the browser.

To resolve this issue, you need to configure CORS settings on your HTTP API in AWS API Gateway. Since you're using AWS CDK for deployment, you can specify CORS settings directly in your CDK stack for your `HttpApi`.

Here is how you can modify your CDK stack to include CORS settings:

```typescript
// Define the HTTP API with CORS enabled
const httpApi = new HttpApi(this, 'HandTermApi', {
  apiName: 'HandTermService',
  description: 'This service serves authentication requests.',
  corsPreflight: {
    allowOrigins: ['http://localhost:5173'], // Specify allowed origins
    allowMethods: [CorsHttpMethod.GET, CorsHttpMethod.POST, CorsHttpMethod.OPTIONS], // Specify allowed methods
    allowHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization'], // Specify allowed headers
    allowCredentials: true, // Important for cookies, authorization headers with HTTPS 
  },
});
```

In the `allowOrigins` array, you should list all the origins that should be allowed to access your API. Since you're currently developing locally, `http://localhost:5173` is necessary. For production, you will need to add the production domain as well.

The `allowCredentials: true` setting is crucial for supporting requests that include cookies or authorization headers, which is exactly what you need for your `getUser` endpoint to receive the `HttpOnly` cookie.

After making these changes, redeploy your CDK stack using `cdk deploy`. This should update your API Gateway configuration with the correct CORS settings.

Please note, if your `getUser` function or any other endpoint requires specific HTTP methods, ensure they are included in the `allowMethods` array. Similarly, if your requests include other custom headers, include them in the `allowHeaders` array.

If you encounter CORS issues in production, remember to update the `allowOrigins` array with your production domain.

---

**User** _at 2:37 pm, Jul 1, 2024_

I have this now in my `cdk-stack.ts`

```ts
  // Define the HTTP API
  const httpApi = new HttpApi(this, 'HandTermApi', {
   apiName: 'HandTermService',
   description: 'This service serves authentication requests.',
   // CORS configuration if needed
   corsPreflight: {
    allowOrigins: ['http://localhost:5173', 'https://handterm.com'],
    allowMethods: [CorsHttpMethod.GET, CorsHttpMethod.POST, CorsHttpMethod.OPTIONS],
    allowHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization'],
    allowCredentials: true,
   },
  });
```

Given that you've updated your CDK stack with the appropriate CORS configuration for your HTTP API and are still encountering CORS policy errors, there are a few additional steps and considerations to ensure everything is set up correctly:

### 1. **Double-check Deployment**
Ensure that the updates made to your CDK stack, specifically the CORS configuration, have been successfully deployed. Sometimes, changes might not propagate due to deployment issues. You can redeploy your stack using:

```shell
cdk deploy
```

### 2. **Verify API Gateway Configuration in AWS Console**
Although you've configured CORS in your CDK stack, it's worth verifying directly in the AWS Management Console that the CORS settings have been correctly applied to your HTTP API. Look for the `HandTermApi` in API Gateway and check the CORS settings under the API Gateway's settings.

### 3. **Clear Browser Cache or Use Incognito Mode**
Browsers can cache CORS policies for a domain, which might result in stale CORS errors even after the policy has been corrected on the server. Try accessing your application in an incognito window or clear your browser cache to ensure you're not seeing a cached error.

### 4. **Inspect Preflight Request**
- Use the browser's Developer Tools (usually accessible with F12 or right-click → "Inspect") and go to the "Network" tab.
- Trigger the `getUser` request by refreshing your application or performing the action that leads to the API call.
- Look for the preflight OPTIONS request to `https://x7jzrjfuv8.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/getUser` and check the response headers. Ensure that the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header is present and correctly set.

### 5. **Ensure `withCredentials` is Set for All Requests**
Make sure that `withCredentials: true` is set for not only your `getUser` request but also any other requests that need to send or receive cookies. This must be done on the client-side in your Axios request or whatever HTTP client library you're using.

### 6. **Review Lambda Function for Manual CORS Header Handling**
If you're manually setting headers in your Lambda function response, ensure you include the necessary CORS headers there as well. This is particularly important if your endpoint does something custom with the response headers:

```typescript
headers: {
  "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "http://localhost:5173",
  "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials": "true",
  // Include other necessary headers
}
```

### 7. **Mismatched HTTPS vs. HTTP**
Your error message indicates a request from `http://localhost:5173` to `https://x7jzrjfuv8.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/getUser`. Ensure there's no mismatch in protocols when specifying the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header. If your site will be served over HTTPS in production, plan accordingly for your CORS configuration.

If after these steps the error persists, consider providing more details about your setup or reaching out to AWS Support for more direct assistance, especially if there might be a configuration issue not readily apparent in the settings you've shared.

To verify the CORS settings of your API Gateway using the AWS CLI, follow these steps. You'll check the CORS configuration for your HTTP API `HandTermApi` to ensure it's correctly set up to respond to requests from your frontend application.

### Step 1: Get the API ID
First, find the ID of your HTTP API by listing all of your APIs. Look for the `apiId` of `HandTermApi`.

```sh
aws apigatewayv2 get-apis
```

This command returns a list of APIs. Identify your API by its name (`HandTermService`) and note the `ApiId`.

### Step 2: Get the CORS Configuration
Once you have your `ApiId`, retrieve the CORS configuration for your API using the following command:

```sh
aws apigatewayv2 get-cors --api-id <ApiId>
```

Replace `<ApiId>` with the actual ID of your API. This command returns the CORS configuration for your API, which should match the settings you've defined in your CDK stack.

### Step 3: Verify the CORS Configuration
The output should include details about the allowed origins, methods, headers, and other CORS-related settings. Specifically, you should see `http://localhost:5173` and `https://handterm.com` listed under `allowOrigins`, and `true` for `allowCredentials`.

### Troubleshooting
If the CORS configuration is not as expected:
- Ensure you've successfully deployed your CDK stack after making the CORS changes.
- Double-check that there are no typos or errors in the CDK code related to the CORS configuration.
- Make sure there's no additional configuration in the Lambda function or elsewhere that might be overriding these settings.

If the CORS settings are correct according to the AWS CLI output but you're still experiencing CORS errors:
- Confirm that your browser is not caching an old version of the CORS policy. Try clearing the cache or testing in an incognito window.
- Ensure your frontend code includes `withCredentials: true` for requests that need to send cookies.
- Check if the API endpoint in your frontend code matches the deployed API stage and route. Sometimes, issues arise if there's a mismatch in the expected URL path.

By verifying the CORS configuration with the AWS CLI and ensuring your frontend is correctly set up to handle credentials, you should be able to resolve the CORS policy errors you're encountering.

It seems there was a misunderstanding or error in the command provided to check the CORS settings for your HTTP API using AWS CLI. My apologies for the oversight. The AWS CLI does not have a direct `get-cors` command for apigatewayv2.

For AWS API Gateway version 2 (which is used for HTTP APIs), CORS configuration is a part of the API resource itself, not a separate entity that can be fetched with a distinct command like `get-cors`. Instead, you should inspect the API configuration or the specific route settings for CORS details.

To see the details of your API, including CORS settings, you can use the `get-api` command:

```sh
aws apigatewayv2 get-api --api-id x7jzrjfuv8
```

This command will return information about the API, but please note that detailed CORS settings might not be explicitly detailed if they are set to default values or if they are managed differently (e.g., through Lambda function responses or through a proxy).

For more granular control and to inspect or configure CORS settings for your HTTP APIs, you often need to manage these settings directly within the API Gateway console or through the API Gateway resource in your AWS CDK or CloudFormation template.

If you're using Lambda functions to handle your routes, ensure that your Lambda function's response headers explicitly include the necessary CORS headers. For example, your Lambda response should include headers like:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 200,
  "headers": {
    "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
    "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials": "true",
    "Access-Control-Allow-Headers": "Content-Type,Authorization",
    "Access-Control-Allow-Methods": "OPTIONS,GET,POST"
  },
  "body": JSON.stringify(data)
}
```

Remember to replace `"Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*"` with your specific domain for production environments to adhere to best security practices.

Since the CLI output didn't help as expected, I recommend:
- Double-checking your Lambda function response headers for CORS.
- Reviewing your API Gateway configurations in the AWS Management Console, especially under the 'CORS' section of your HTTP API.

If CORS settings seem correct but you're still facing issues, it may be beneficial to inspect the network requests in your browser's developer tools closely, as sometimes the problem may not be with the API configuration but with how the requests are made or how the environment (e.g., localhost vs. production) is handled.

The output from the AWS CLI command `aws apigatewayv2 get-api --api-id x7jzrjfuv8` shows that your HTTP API (`HandTermService`) has CORS configured correctly. The CORS configuration explicitly allows credentials (`AllowCredentials: true`) and includes both `http://localhost:5173` and `https://handterm.com` in `AllowOrigins`. It also permits `GET`, `POST`, and `OPTIONS` methods, which are typical for RESTful APIs, and expects `content-type` and `authorization` in `AllowHeaders`.

Given this configuration, your API is set up to respond correctly to CORS preflight requests from your specified origins, and to support credentials (such as cookies or HTTP authentication methods). Since you're still encountering a CORS policy error, consider the following additional checks and steps:

### 1. **Ensure Endpoint URL Matches API Gateway Deployment**
Verify the request URL matches the deployed API's endpoint. Sometimes, issues arise due to incorrect base URLs, especially if there are stages involved (like `/dev`, `/prod`) that haven't been accounted for in the URL.

### 2. **Confirm HTTP Method and Headers**
Ensure the client-side request uses the correct HTTP method (`GET` for `getUser`) and includes the necessary headers (`Content-Type` and `Authorization`, if applicable). Since you're using cookies for authentication, the `Authorization` header may not be needed, but the `Content-Type` should match what your API expects.

### 3. **Check Browser and Network**
- **Browser Cache**: Clear your browser cache or try an incognito window to ensure you're not seeing a cached response.
- **Proxy or Network Configuration**: If you're behind a proxy or certain network configurations, they might interfere with the request. Test from another network environment if possible.

### 4. **Review Lambda Function Response**
Even though CORS is configured at the API Gateway level, ensure your Lambda function isn't returning anything that might conflict with the CORS policy. The Lambda function should not return CORS headers that conflict with what's set at the API Gateway level.

### 5. **Test with a Simplified Request**
Use tools like Postman or curl from the command line to make a simplified request to your `getUser` endpoint. This can help isolate whether the issue is with the API configuration or the way the request is made from the client application.

For a curl example, you can try:

```sh
curl -X OPTIONS https://x7jzrjfuv8.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/getUser \
-H "Origin: http://localhost:5173" \
-H "Access-Control-Request-Method: GET" \
-H "Access-Control-Request-Headers: content-type" \
-v
```

This sends a preflight request similar to what a browser does. Look for `Access-Control-Allow-*` headers in the response.

### Next Steps
If these steps do not resolve the issue or indicate where the problem might be, it may be helpful to:
- Provide more details about the `getUser` endpoint's configuration and the Lambda function it invokes.
- Share how you're making the request from the client-side, including any relevant code snippets.

This detailed information can offer further insights into what might be causing the CORS policy error you're encountering.

Using `curl` to simulate a request that requires credentials (like cookies or authentication headers set with `withCredentials` in JavaScript) is definitely possible, but with some limitations. The `withCredentials` flag in XMLHttpRequest or the Fetch API essentially tells the browser to include credentials like cookies, authorization headers, or TLS client certificates in cross-origin requests. When using `curl`, you manually manage these headers.

To simulate a request with credentials using `curl`, you would need to include the relevant headers explicitly. For cookies, you can use the `Cookie` header. If your request relies on an authorization token, you'd use the `Authorization` header.

Here's how you might structure such a request with `curl`:

```sh
curl https://x7jzrjfuv8.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/getUser \
  -H "Origin: http://localhost:5173" \
  -H "Cookie: yourCookieName=yourCookieValue" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --verbose
```

However, there are two important caveats to note:

1. **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a Browser Mechanism**: Tools like `curl` don't adhere to the same-origin policy like browsers do. This means `curl` can send requests to any server without restriction, but it won't automatically handle CORS preflight requests (`OPTIONS` requests) like a browser. When you use `curl`, you're bypassing CORS checks entirely, which can be useful for testing the server response directly but won't replicate browser-specific CORS issues.

2. **Session Cookies**: If your API relies on session cookies set by the server, you'll need to first obtain those cookies (likely from a login request or a Set-Cookie header in a server response) and then manually include them in subsequent `curl` requests. This is a bit more manual but can be done for testing purposes.

Given the error message from your browser, it seems like the server is not including the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header in its response to the preflight request, or it's not matching the origin of your request (`http://localhost:5173`). While using `curl` can help test the server's response directly by including the necessary headers, it won't help diagnose CORS issues since those are browser-specific.

To further diagnose and address CORS issues, you should:
- Verify the server's response headers include `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` that matches the request's origin or is a wildcard (`*`). Note, however, that wildcards and credentials (`withCredentials: true`) cannot be used together.
- Check the server configuration to ensure it's correctly handling `OPTIONS` preflight requests and responding with the appropriate CORS headers.
- Ensure there's no intermediary (like a reverse proxy) altering or stripping headers from your response that could affect CORS.

If your application and API are correctly configured and you're still encountering CORS issues, you may need to review the specific configurations within AWS API Gateway or your server's response handling code to ensure CORS responses are being correctly generated and sent for preflight and actual requests.

I need the `curl` calls in PowerShell, which uses a backtick for line continuation.

---

**Codeium** _at 2:54 pm, Jul 1, 2024_

For making `curl` requests in PowerShell, which uses backticks (`) for line continuation, you can adjust the `curl` command as follows. Note that in PowerShell, `curl` is an alias for `Invoke-WebRequest`, but for consistency with Unix-like usage and direct compatibility, you might prefer using the `curl.exe` command explicitly if it's available in your environment. This ensures you're using the same `curl` as in Unix-like systems.

Here's how you can structure a `curl` command in PowerShell to include headers and simulate a request with credentials:

```powershell
curl.exe https://x7jzrjfuv8.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/getUser `
  -H "Origin: http://localhost:5173" `
  -H "Cookie: yourCookieName=yourCookieValue" `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  --verbose
```

This command explicitly sets the request headers for `Origin`, `Cookie`, and `Content-Type`. Adjust `yourCookieName=yourCookieValue` with the actual cookie name and value you need to send with your request.

### Points to Consider:

- **Explicitly Using `curl.exe`**: PowerShell has built-in cmdlets like `Invoke-WebRequest` and `Invoke-RestMethod` that are aliased to `curl` and `wget`, which might cause confusion. Using `curl.exe` ensures you're invoking the external `curl` command, not the PowerShell cmdlet.
- **Verbose Output**: The `--verbose` flag is used here to get detailed information about the request and response, which can be helpful for debugging.
- **Handling Cookies**: If the server sets cookies that your client needs to send with subsequent requests, you'll need to extract those from the server's response and include them in the `Cookie` header as shown. For initial testing, you might manually obtain the cookie value from a browser's developer tools and include it here.
- **PowerShell Alternatives**: For a more 'PowerShell-native' approach, consider using `Invoke-WebRequest` or `Invoke-RestMethod` cmdlets, which offer more integration with PowerShell features like objects and pipelining. They automatically handle line continuation without special characters, but you would structure the command differently, using parameters like `-Headers @{}` to specify headers.

Remember, while `curl` (or `curl.exe` in Windows) bypasses browser-based CORS restrictions by not enforcing them, testing with `curl` can help verify server responses but might not replicate CORS issues that occur in a browser environment.

**Codeium** _at 2:56 pm, Jul 1, 2024_

The response from your `curl` command provides several key insights into the issue at hand:

1. **Connection and Request Headers**: The connection to the API Gateway endpoint is successful, and your request headers are correctly included. This shows that your `curl` command is well-formed and reaching the server as intended.

2. **HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized**: The server responded with a `401 Unauthorized` status code. This indicates that the server recognized the request but refused to authorize it. Given the `www-authenticate: Bearer` header in the response, it suggests that the server expects a valid Bearer token for authentication.

3. **Access-Control-Allow-Origin**: The response includes the `access-control-allow-origin: http://localhost:5173` header and `access-control-allow-credentials: true`, indicating that your CORS configuration is correctly allowing requests from `http://localhost:5173` and is configured to support credentials (like cookies or HTTP authentication methods).

### Understanding the 401 Unauthorized Error

Given this information, the `401 Unauthorized` error points to an authentication issue. Here are a few possibilities to consider:

- **Invalid or Missing Bearer Token**: If your API expects a Bearer token for authentication, ensure it is provided in the `Authorization` header of your request. The `Cookie: yourCookieName=yourCookieValue` header you included might not be what the API expects for authentication, or the value might be incorrect or expired.
  
- **Incorrect Authentication Mechanism**: If your endpoint is supposed to authenticate using cookies rather than Bearer tokens, ensure that the cookie name and value are correct. "yourCookieName=yourCookieValue" should be replaced with the actual cookie name and value received from a previous authentication response (e.g., from a login endpoint).

### Next Steps

To address the `401 Unauthorized` error:

- **Verify Authentication Token**: If you're using Bearer tokens, ensure that the token is valid and has not expired. You might need to obtain a new token from your authentication provider or identity service.

- **Check Cookie Value**: If authentication relies on cookies, double-check that you're using the correct cookie name and value. Ensure that the cookie hasn't expired and is intended for use with the API domain.

- **Review API Gateway and Lambda Configuration**: Double-check your API Gateway and Lambda function configurations to ensure they are set up to handle authentication as expected. This includes reviewing any authorizer configurations and ensuring that your Lambda function logic correctly processes the authentication credentials provided in requests.

- **Debugging and Further Testing**: Consider testing with a known good token or credentials to isolate whether the issue is with the specific credentials you're using or with the API's authentication configuration. You might also test directly against any authentication endpoints (e.g., a login endpoint) to ensure they're behaving as expected.

If you have access to the server-side logs (e.g., CloudWatch logs for your AWS Lambda function), reviewing those logs can provide more insights into why the request is being unauthorized. Look for any log entries generated around the time of your `curl` request for clues on the authentication failure.

**User** _at 3:01 pm, Jul 1, 2024_

I am trying to use the HttpOnly Cookie that you and I set up. I think it is called `idToken` at this point. 

I have not been trying to use a bearer token, if that process is better served by the HttpOnly Cookie. 

I probably need to remove the bearer token requirement from somewhere.

---

**Codeium** _at 3:01 pm, Jul 1, 2024_

Given that your intention is to use an HttpOnly cookie named `idToken` for authentication, rather than a bearer token, the `401 Unauthorized` response you're encountering likely stems from the API expecting a different form of authentication than you're providing. Here’s how you can address this situation based on your setup and intention to use HttpOnly cookies for authentication:

### 1. **Review API Gateway Authorizer Configuration**
- If your API Gateway route for `/getUser` is configured to use a JWT authorizer or any authorizer that expects a bearer token, you'll need to adjust this. Since you're using an HttpOnly cookie, the authorization should be handled by your backend (e.g., a Lambda function) that can access cookies, not by API Gateway's built-in authorizers that expect authorization metadata in headers.
- Check your API Gateway configuration in the AWS Management Console to see if the route for `/getUser` is associated with an authorizer and consider removing or modifying this if it's not compatible with cookie-based authentication.

### 2. **Adjust Backend to Validate HttpOnly Cookie**
- Ensure your backend service (e.g., the Lambda function serving `/getUser`) is prepared to validate the session using the `idToken` cookie. This involves parsing the cookie from the incoming request, validating the token contained within, and then proceeding based on the validation result.
- Depending on how you're managing sessions, validation might involve checking the token against a database of active sessions, or if `idToken` is a JWT, you could validate its signature and claims directly within the Lambda function.

### 3. **Ensure Cookies are Sent with Requests**
- When making requests from your front end, ensure that `withCredentials` is set to `true` for requests using Axios (or an equivalent configuration for other HTTP clients). This instructs the browser to include cookies in the request to your API.

### Example of Adjusting Lambda Function for Cookie Validation
If your Lambda function is in Node.js, here’s a basic example of how it might extract and validate an `idToken` cookie:

```javascript
const { verifyToken } = require('./yourTokenValidationUtility');

exports.handler = async (event) => {
    // Extract the Cookie header
    const cookieHeader = event.headers['Cookie'] || event.headers['cookie'];
    
    if (!cookieHeader) {
        return { statusCode: 401, body: 'Unauthorized' };
    }
    
    // Parse the Cookie header to find the idToken
    const cookies = cookieHeader.split(';').reduce((acc, cookie) => {
        const [key, value] = cookie.split('=').map(c => c.trim());
        acc[key] = value;
        return acc;
    }, {});
    
    const idToken = cookies['idToken'];
    
    if (!idToken || !verifyToken(idToken)) {
        return { statusCode: 401, body: 'Unauthorized' };
    }
    
    // Proceed with your logic after validation
    return {
        statusCode: 200,
        body: JSON.stringify({ message: "Success" }),
    };
};
```

In this example, `verifyToken` is a hypothetical function you would implement to validate the `idToken`. Its implementation would depend on how your tokens are structured and how you manage sessions/authentication in your application.

### 4. **Removing Bearer Token Requirement**
- If you have explicitly set up your application or API Gateway to require a bearer token, you'll need to remove or bypass this requirement in favor of cookie-based authentication. This might involve changing API Gateway settings or adjusting your backend logic.

Following these steps should align your authentication flow with using HttpOnly cookies and resolve the unauthorized errors you're encountering.

Does something in that require Bearer tokens?

These are the headers used in the Axios request, and I sent you a sample from the browser confirming that "WithCredentials" are set to true.

I don't know what the `veryToken` handler is or where to introduce it in the CDK stack. Is this something new? I am wonmdering why it was not included in any of the earlier plans.

---

**Codeium** _at 3:08 pm, Jul 1, 2024_

From the CDK code you've provided, the `HttpUserPoolAuthorizer` attached to your routes, such as for the `changePassword` and `getUser` functions, indicates that these endpoints are protected by Cognito User Pool authorization. This setup indeed expects an Authorization header containing a JWT token (Bearer token). This is why your requests are being rejected when you're trying to use an HttpOnly cookie (`idToken`) for authentication instead.

Here’s the key part of your setup that's causing this behavior:

```ts
const cognitoAuthorizer = new HttpUserPoolAuthorizer('CognitoAuthorizer', userPool);
...
httpApi.addRoutes({
  path: ENDPOINTS.api.GetUser,
  methods: [HttpMethod.GET],
  authorizer: cognitoAuthorizer,
  integration: getUserIntegration,
})
```

This sets up the `getUser` endpoint to require a valid JWT in the Authorization header, authenticated against the Cognito User Pool.

### Adjusting for HttpOnly Cookie Authentication

To use HttpOnly cookies for authentication with your setup, you would typically handle the authentication in your Lambda function (`getUser.handler`, `signIn.handler`, etc.) by verifying the token provided in the cookie against Cognito within the Lambda function itself, rather than using API Gateway's built-in Cognito authorizer. This involves a few changes:

1. **Remove the `HttpUserPoolAuthorizer` for Routes Needing Cookie Authentication**: Removing or not setting the `authorizer` property for routes that should use cookie-based authentication will prevent API Gateway from rejecting requests lacking a Bearer token.

2. **Implement Token Verification in Lambda Functions**: Inside your Lambda function, you will need to manually verify the `idToken` cookie. This involves parsing the cookie from the request, decoding the JWT, and then verifying it against Cognito's public keys. AWS SDK for JavaScript (v3) provides utilities that can help with this, or you could use a library like `jsonwebtoken` to decode and verify JWT tokens.

3. **`verifyToken` Handler Introduction**: The mention of a `verifyToken` handler seems to have been a confusion with a custom token verification step you'd need to implement in your Lambda functions if you're manually handling token verification. This is not something provided out-of-the-box by CDK or AWS Lambda but is rather a custom implementation detail based on your application's authentication logic.

### Example Approach for Custom Token Verification:

You would extract the token from the cookie in the Lambda function and then verify it. Here's a very simplified outline of what the code in your Lambda function might look like:

```javascript
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const axios = require('axios');

exports.handler = async (event) => {
    const token = extractTokenFromCookie(event.headers.cookie);
    if (!token) return { statusCode: 401, body: 'No token provided' };

    const isValid = await verifyToken(token);
    if (!isValid) return { statusCode: 401, body: 'Unauthorized' };

    // Proceed with your function logic
};

function extractTokenFromCookie(cookieHeader) {
    // Simplified example; you'll need to parse the actual cookie header
    const match = cookieHeader?.match(/idToken=([^;]+)/);
    return match ? match[1] : null;
}

async function verifyToken(token) {
    // This is a placeholder. In reality, you'd need to fetch the JWKS from Cognito,
    // verify the token's signature, and check its claims (expiration, audience, etc.)
    return true; // Stubbed as always valid for this example
}
```

### Next Steps:

- **Update your Lambda functions** to include token verification logic as outlined above or through a similar method that fits your application's architecture.
- **Adjust your CDK stack** to remove the `authorizer` from routes where you plan to use cookie-based authentication, ensuring those requests reach your Lambda function for custom processing.

By adjusting your setup to handle token verification within your Lambda functions, you can fully control authentication via HttpOnly cookies, sidestepping the need for Bearer tokens through API Gateway's authorizers for those specific routes.

**User** _at 3:25 pm, Jul 1, 2024_

When I sign in I get a cookie called `idToken` but it has a domain of `x7jzrjfuv8.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`, which is not `http://localhost:5173`.

When my code uses axios to send a subsequent request "WithCredentials`, will it even be able to send the cookie with the `x7jzrjfuv8.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com` domain?

---

**Codeium** _at 3:26 pm, Jul 1, 2024_

Cookies are restricted by the same-origin policy, which means a browser will only send cookies back to the same domain (and subdomain, depending on the cookie's domain attribute) from which they were set. In your case, a cookie set by `x7jzrjfuv8.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com` will not be automatically sent by the browser to any other domain, including `http://localhost:5173`, because they do not share the same origin.

This behavior is fundamental to browser security, preventing cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks among other potential security issues. Here’s what this means for your application:

1. **Direct Communication with API Gateway**: When your frontend application, served from `http://localhost:5173`, tries to send a request with credentials to `x7jzrjfuv8.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`, the browser will not include the `idToken` cookie unless the request is being made directly back to `x7jzrjfuv8.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`. This is due to the cookie's domain attribute not matching the domain of your frontend application.

2. **Cookie Domain Matching**: For a cookie to be sent from a page hosted on one domain (or subdomain) to an API on another, the cookie's `Domain` attribute must be set to a common domain shared by both. However, setting such cross-domain cookies is restricted, and generally, cookies can only be set for the domain of the request. 

3. **Development vs. Production**: In a development environment like `localhost`, it's common to encounter these types of issues. One workaround is to use a proxy configuration during development that makes API requests appear to come from the same origin, or to adjust your local environment to mimic your production domain settings more closely. For production, ensuring your application and API are served from the same domain or subdomain can simplify cookie handling.

### Solutions and Workarounds

- **Use a Proxy During Development**: Tools like Webpack (used by Create React App) allow you to set up a proxy for development purposes. This way, requests to your API can be made to a path on your local server, which then proxies the request to the actual API. This approach makes the request appear to originate from the same domain, circumventing the issue.

- **Adjust Local DNS or Hosts File**: For a more consistent development and production environment, consider using a local DNS server or editing your hosts file to map a domain (e.g., `dev.myapp.com`) to your local development environment (`127.0.0.1`). You can then configure your API to set cookies for `.myapp.com`, which will work for both `dev.myapp.com` and your production domain.

- **Environment Configuration**: Ensure that your API and frontend are configured to operate under the same domain in production. You might also configure your API to set the `Domain` attribute of the cookie to a common base domain when in a production environment.

In summary, for your local development setup, you will likely need to employ a development proxy or similar workaround to effectively work with cookies set by your API. For production, aligning your application and API under a common domain will enable cookies to be shared seamlessly between them.

Ok, I think I finally understand how the HttpOnly Cookies work.

I shouldn't use Cognito validation anywhere in the CDK. I have to parse the cookie from the header on the server and then make a call from the lambda function to Cognito to validate the cookie and get the userId form Cognito.

How can I do that in here?

```ts
// cdk/lambda/authentication/checkConnection.ts

import * as AWS from 'aws-sdk';
import { ENDPOINTS } from '../../cdkshared/endpoints';
import * as jwt from 'jsonwebtoken';

const s3 = new AWS.S3({ region: 'us-east-1' });
const cognito = new AWS.CognitoIdentityServiceProvider({ region: 'us-east-1' });

function parseCookies(cookieHeader: string) {
  const cookies: { [key: string]: string } = {};
  cookieHeader.split(';').forEach(cookie => {
    const [name, value] = cookie.trim().split('=');
    cookies[name] = value;
  });
  return cookies;
}

function decodeToken(token: string) {
  return jwt.decode(token);
}

export const handler = async (event: any) => {
  const cookies = event.headers['Cookie'] || event.headers['cookie'];
  let response = { statusCode: 401, body: 'Unauthorized', log: 'init\r' };
  try {
    // Parse the cookies to extract needed tokens
    const idToken = parseCookies(cookies).idToken;
    response.log += `idToken: ${idToken}\r`;
    // Identify the user from the token and proceed with S3 operations
    const decodedToken = decodeToken(idToken);
    if (!decodedToken) {
      // Handle the case where the token cannot be decoded
      return { statusCode: 400, body: JSON.stringify({ error: "Invalid token" }) };
    }

    // If the token is successfully decoded, proceed with using the decodedToken object
    const userId = decodedToken.sub;
    response.log += `userId: ${userId}\r`;
    // Example S3 operation
    const objectKey = `user_data/${userId}/data.txt`;
    response.log += `objectKey: ${objectKey}\r`;
    const s3Response = await s3.getObject({ Bucket: ENDPOINTS.aws.s3.bucketName, Key: objectKey }).promise();
    response.log += `s3Response: ${s3Response}\r`;
    // If the file is found, return its content
    const fileContent = s3Response.Body?.toString('utf-8');
    response.log += `fileContent: ${fileContent}\r`;
    response.statusCode = 200;
    response.body = JSON.stringify({ userId: userId, content: fileContent });
    return response;
  } catch (err) {
    response.statusCode = 500;

    return { statusCode: 500, body: JSON.stringify(err) };
  }
}
```

To validate the `idToken` received from the client with AWS Cognito in your Lambda function (`checkConnection.ts`), you need to interact with Cognito to verify the token's integrity and authenticity. The `jsonwebtoken` library you're using can decode JWTs but doesn't verify them. For verification, you should use AWS Cognito's built-in support.

AWS Cognito tokens are JWTs signed by an AWS Cognito User Pool. To verify the token, you need to check the token's signature against the public keys provided by Cognito. AWS publishes these keys at an HTTPS endpoint specific to your user pool. However, AWS SDK for JavaScript provides a more straightforward way to interact with Cognito for user information without manually verifying the token signature.

Here's how you can modify your `handler` function to use AWS Cognito to get the user's information, which also implicitly verifies the token:

1. **Extract the Token**: You've already extracted the `idToken` from the cookies.

2. **Use AWS SDK to Get the User Information**: Instead of directly decoding the JWT, use Cognito's `getUser` method, which requires an access token. If you must work with `idToken`, you'd typically verify it against the JWKS for your user pool. For simplicity and direct AWS SDK support, consider using the access token if possible for user identity tasks.

Below is an adjusted version of your handler function implementing the step to get user information from Cognito. This example assumes the use of an access token; if you're working strictly with an `idToken` and require validation of this token specifically, you would need to implement additional steps to fetch Cognito's JWKS and verify the token signature manually or via a library that supports JWKS-based verification.

```typescript
import * as AWS from 'aws-sdk';
import { ENDPOINTS } from '../../cdkshared/endpoints';

const s3 = new AWS.S3({ region: 'us-east-1' });
const cognito = new AWS.CognitoIdentityServiceProvider({ region: 'us-east-1' });

function parseCookies(cookieHeader: string) {
    const cookies: { [key: string]: string } = {};
    cookieHeader.split(';').forEach(cookie => {
        const [name, value] = cookie.trim().split('=');
        cookies[name] = value;
    });
    return cookies;
}

export const handler = async (event: any) => {
    const cookies = event.headers['Cookie'] || event.headers['cookie'];
    let response = { statusCode: 401, body: 'Unauthorized', log: 'init\r' };
    try {
        // Parse the cookies to extract the token
        const accessToken = parseCookies(cookies).idToken; // Consider renaming if using an actual access token
        response.log += `accessToken: ${accessToken}\r`;

        // Use the accessToken to get user information from Cognito
        const user = await cognito.getUser({
            AccessToken: accessToken
        }).promise();

        const userId = user.Username;
        response.log += `userId: ${userId}\r`;

        // Example S3 operation
        const objectKey = `user_data/${userId}/data.txt`;
        response.log += `objectKey: ${objectKey}\r`;
        const s3Response = await s3.getObject({ Bucket: ENDPOINTS.aws.s3.bucketName, Key: objectKey }).promise();
        response.log += `s3Response: ${s3Response}\r`;

        // If the file is found, return its content
        const fileContent = s3Response.Body?.toString('utf-8');
        response.log += `fileContent: ${fileContent}\r`;
        response.statusCode = 200;
        response.body = JSON.stringify({ userId: userId, content: fileContent });
        return response;
    } catch (err) {
        response.statusCode = 500;
        return { statusCode: 500, body: JSON.stringify(err) };
    }
}
```

Please note:
- This example uses `idToken` as the name for the access token, but you might be actually dealing with an ID token. Ensure you're using the correct token type for your authentication flow.
- If you need to verify the `idToken` specifically (for example, to extract custom claims), you would need to handle the JWT verification process, including fetching the JWKS for signature validation. AWS does not provide a direct API to verify ID tokens via the SDK.
- Error handling should be expanded based on the specific needs of your application, especially around the AWS API calls.

I want to run a test in  the AWS console test runner for the Lambda, but I don't know how to format the test JSON to include the token. 

How can I do that?

---

**Codeium** _at 4:54 pm, Jul 1, 2024_

To test your Lambda function in the AWS Lambda console with a scenario that includes a cookie (like the `idToken` cookie you're using for authentication), you'll need to simulate an HTTP request that includes the `Cookie` header. This involves creating a test event in the AWS Lambda console that mimics the structure of an event that your function would receive from API Gateway with the `Cookie` header set.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to format the JSON for the test event:

1. **Open the AWS Lambda Console**: Navigate to your Lambda function.
2. **Configure a Test Event**: In the function's actions, find the option to configure test events. This might be under a dropdown menu labeled “Test” or a button depending on the console's current layout.
3. **Create a New Test Event**: Choose to create a new test event. You may be prompted to select a template for your test event. Since you’re simulating an API Gateway event, you can start with the `API Gateway AWS Proxy` template if it’s available, or start with an empty template.

```json
{
  "body": "",
  "resource": "/{proxy+}",
  "path": "/getUser",
  "httpMethod": "GET",
  "isBase64Encoded": false,
  "queryStringParameters": {},
  "multiValueQueryStringParameters": {},
  "pathParameters": {},
  "stageVariables": {},
  "headers": {
    "Cookie": "idToken=yourTokenValueHere"
  },
  "requestContext": {
    "resourceId": "123456",
    "apiId": "1234567890",
    "resourcePath": "/{proxy+}",
    "httpMethod": "GET",
    "requestId": "c6af9ac6-7b61-11e6-9a41-157e1e763a28",
    "accountId": "123456789012",
    "stage": "prod",
    "identity": {
      "apiKey": null,
      "userArn": null,
      "cognitoAuthenticationType": null,
      "caller": null,
      "userAgent": "Custom User Agent String",
      "user": null,
      "cognitoIdentityPoolId": null,
      "cognitoIdentityId": null,
      "cognitoAuthenticationProvider": null,
      "sourceIp": "127.0.0.1",
      "accountId": null
    },
    "extendedRequestId": null,
    "httpMethod": "GET",
    "path": "/getUser"
  }
}
```

4. **Customize the Test Event**: Edit the template to match the specifics of your API call. The critical part is the `headers` section, where you need to include the `Cookie` header with your `idToken`. Replace `yourTokenValueHere` with the actual token you want to test with.

5. **Save and Test**: Save the test event with a meaningful name, and then use it to test your Lambda function. This will simulate an invocation of your Lambda function as if it were being triggered by an API Gateway event with the `Cookie` header included.

This test will allow you to verify that your Lambda function correctly handles the cookie header, parses the token, and performs the expected logic. Remember, since this is a simulation, aspects like actual authentication or authorization behavior that rely on external systems (like Cognito) will need those systems to be reachable and correctly configured for your test token to be considered valid.

The error message you're encountering indicates a Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy issue. CORS is enforced by browsers to prevent web pages from making requests to a domain different from the one that served the web page, unless the server at the target domain explicitly allows such requests.

Given your setup, where the frontend served from `http://localhost:5173` is making a request to your AWS API Gateway endpoint at `https://x7jzrjfuv8.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/getUser`, you need to ensure that your API Gateway configuration includes the appropriate CORS settings.

### Resolving the CORS Issue

1. **Ensure CORS is Enabled on API Gateway**: You need to enable CORS on your API Gateway endpoint and specify `http://localhost:5173` as an allowed origin. Also, ensure you allow the specific headers and methods your frontend uses. For a `getUser` request, at minimum, you'll need to allow `GET` methods and likely `Content-Type`, `Authorization`, and potentially custom headers you use.

2. **Configure CORS in Your Serverless Application**: Based on the CDK code you provided earlier, you had some CORS configuration in place. However, you need to ensure that the `allowOrigins` array includes `http://localhost:5173`, and the `allowMethods` includes `HttpMethod.GET` for your `/getUser` endpoint. If you're dynamically generating tokens or using specific headers, you also need to ensure `allowHeaders` includes these. Here's an example snippet from your CDK setup that shows where to check these settings:

    ```typescript
    // Define the HTTP API CORS configuration
    const httpApi = new HttpApi(this, 'HandTermApi', {
        ...
        corsPreflight: {
            allowOrigins: ['http://localhost:5173', 'https://handterm.com'],
            allowMethods: [CorsHttpMethod.GET, CorsHttpMethod.POST, CorsHttpMethod.OPTIONS],
            allowHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization'],
            allowCredentials: true,
        },
    });
    ```

    Make sure your actual deployment matches these settings.

3. **Deploy Changes**: After adjusting your CDK script, redeploy your stack to ensure the changes take effect. Changes to CORS settings in API Gateway through CDK require redeployment to apply.

4. **Testing CORS Configuration**: You can test the CORS configuration directly using tools like `curl` from the command line. Here's an example:

    ```bash
    curl -H "Origin: http://localhost:5173" \
      -X OPTIONS \
      https://x7jzrjfuv8.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/getUser \
      -i
    ```
    
    Look for `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` in the response headers. It should match the origin you're testing from (`http://localhost:5173` in this case).

If after ensuring your CORS configuration is correct and redeploying your API you still encounter issues, double-check:

- **API Gateway Deployment**: Make sure the deployment is up-to-date with your latest configurations.
- **Browser Cache**: Clear your browser cache or try an incognito window to ensure you're not seeing a cached response.
- **Inspect Pre-Flight Request**: Modern browsers use an OPTIONS pre-flight request to check CORS policies before sending the actual request. Inspecting this pre-flight request in your browser's developer tools (Network tab) can provide insights into what's going wrong.

---

**User** _at 5:54 pm, Jul 1, 2024_

This is the response I get:

```sh
 curl -H "Origin: http://localhost:5173" \
 -X OPTIONS \
 https://x7jzrjfuv8.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/getUser \
 -i
HTTP/2 204
date: Tue, 02 Jul 2024 00:53:52 GMT
apigw-requestid: aQlhDgg8oAMEbIw=
```

---

**Codeium** _at 5:55 pm, Jul 1, 2024_

The response you received from the `curl` command indicates that the OPTIONS request to your API endpoint `https://x7jzrjfuv8.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/getUser` resulted in a `204 No Content` status, which is expected for a successful OPTIONS preflight response. However, the absence of `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` and other CORS-related headers in the response suggests that the CORS configuration on your API Gateway is not correctly set up or not being returned as expected for CORS preflight requests.

### Steps to Resolve the Issue

1. **Verify and Adjust CORS Settings in API Gateway**:
   Ensure that your API Gateway CORS configuration explicitly allows requests from `http://localhost:5173` and includes the necessary headers. The `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`, and `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` response headers should be present in the response to preflight OPTIONS requests. Given your setup in AWS CDK, double-check that your CORS configuration matches your requirements and redeploy if any changes are made.
   
2. **Redeploy Your API**:
   Sometimes, changes to the API configuration might not fully propagate until you redeploy the API. Ensure that you redeploy your API in the AWS Management Console or via the AWS CLI/CDK after making changes to the CORS configuration.

3. **Manual CORS Configuration**:
   If automated CORS configuration via CDK or the API Gateway console does not seem to apply, consider manually adding the CORS headers in your Lambda function or within the API Gateway method response settings. This approach is less preferred due to increased maintenance and the potential for misconfiguration but can serve as a temporary workaround.

4. **Check API Gateway Stage**:
   Ensure that the API Gateway stage you are testing against matches the one you have configured CORS for. Sometimes, configurations might be stage-specific.

5. **Confirm API Deployment**:
   After modifying CORS settings or any API settings, confirm that the latest version of your API is deployed. It's a common pitfall to update configurations without redeploying the API, resulting in older configurations being used.

### Testing Again After Adjustments

After making adjustments, test the OPTIONS request again with `curl` to confirm that the necessary CORS headers are present in the response:

```sh
curl -H "Origin: http://localhost:5173" \
  -X OPTIONS \
  https://x7jzrjfuv8.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/getUser \
  -i
```

You should see headers like `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`, and `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` in the response, indicating that CORS is configured correctly. If these headers are still missing, review the steps above and ensure that the changes have been applied and deployed correctly.

**User** _at 6:00 pm, Jul 1, 2024_

Here is the current code in the `cdk-stack.ts`

```ts
  // Define the HTTP API
  const httpApi = new HttpApi(this, 'HandTermApi', {
   apiName: 'HandTermService',
   description: 'This service serves authentication requests.',
   // CORS configuration if needed
   corsPreflight: {
    allowOrigins: ['http://localhost:5173', 'https://handterm.com'],
    allowMethods: [CorsHttpMethod.GET, CorsHttpMethod.POST, CorsHttpMethod.OPTIONS],

Can't we inspect the settings on the `getUser` directly, using AWS CLI or something?

---

**Codeium** _at 6:00 pm, Jul 1, 2024_

Given your situation and the need to directly inspect the settings for the `getUser` route in your API Gateway to troubleshoot the CORS issue, you can indeed use the AWS CLI to inspect the configuration. Specifically, you would want to look at the integration response settings and the route response settings to ensure CORS headers are correctly configured to be returned in responses.

### Inspecting Route Settings

To inspect the route settings, including CORS configuration for your `getUser` route, you can use the AWS CLI's `get-route` command. However, you'll need the API Gateway identifier and the route identifier. If you don't have the route identifier, you can list all routes for your API to find it.

1. **List Routes for Your API**:
```sh
aws apigatewayv2 get-routes --api-id <api-id>
```
Replace `<api-id>` with your API Gateway ID (`x7jzrjfuv8` in your case).

2. **Inspect a Specific Route**:
Once you have the route ID for the `getUser` route, you can inspect it directly:
```sh
aws apigatewayv2 get-route --api-id <api-id> --route-id <route-id>
```
Replace `<route-id>` with the ID of your `getUser` route obtained from the previous command.

### Inspecting Integration Responses

CORS headers are often specified in the integration response settings. You can use the AWS CLI to inspect these settings.

1. **List Integrations**:
First, find your integration ID for the `getUser` route:
```sh
aws apigatewayv2 get-integrations --api-id <api-id>
```

2. **Inspect Integration Responses**:
With the integration ID, you can now inspect the integration response settings:
```sh
aws apigatewayv2 get-integration-response --api-id <api-id> --integration-id <integration-id>
```

### Ensuring CORS Headers are Included

In both the route response and integration response settings, ensure that the CORS headers (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`, `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`, etc.) are correctly specified. If they're missing, you'll need to add them.

To add or update the CORS configuration for a route response, you can use the `update-route-response` command. For integration responses, use the `update-integration-response` command. Both commands allow you to specify `ResponseParameters` where you can define your CORS headers.

For example, to update an integration response to include CORS headers:
```sh
aws apigatewayv2 update-integration-response --api-id <api-id> --integration-id <integration-id> --integration-response-id <integration-response-id> --response-parameters "method.response.header.Access-Control-Allow-Origin"="'*'"
```

Remember to replace placeholders with your actual API ID, integration ID, and the specific IDs for your routes and integrations.

### Final Note
If after verifying and adjusting settings through the AWS CLI you're still encountering CORS issues, double-check:
- That the deployed API stage is up-to-date with your latest configurations.
- There are no typos or omissions in the header names and values.
- The changes have been fully deployed and propagated.

This approach should help you pinpoint and resolve the CORS configuration issue for your `getUser` route in AWS API Gateway.

**User** _at 6:07 pm, Jul 1, 2024_

I believe each of those requests can be piped into the next request in PowerShell. You can use tools like `Where-Object` and `Select-Object -ExpandProperty` to chain the results of one function into the next function.

Could you do that so that I can easily post the results back into this chat?

---

**Codeium** _at 6:07 pm, Jul 1, 2024_

Certainly! You can use PowerShell to streamline the process of inspecting your AWS API Gateway configuration by chaining commands together. This will help you inspect the route and integration settings for the `getUser` endpoint systematically. Below are the steps to achieve this using PowerShell, leveraging `Where-Object`, `Select-Object`, and other cmdlets for processing.

### Step 1: List All Routes and Find `getUser` Route ID

First, list all routes for your API and find the route ID for the `getUser` route.

```powershell
$ApiId = "x7jzrjfuv8" # Replace with your actual API ID
$GetUserRoute = aws apigatewayv2 get-routes --api-id $ApiId | ConvertFrom-Json | Where-Object { $_.Items.Path -eq "/getUser" }
$GetUserRouteId = $GetUserRoute.RouteId
```

### Step 2: Inspect the `getUser` Route

Next, use the route ID obtained to inspect the specific route.

```powershell
$GetUserRouteDetails = aws apigatewayv2 get-route --api-id $ApiId --route-id $GetUserRouteId | ConvertFrom-Json
```

### Step 3: List Integrations and Find Related Integration ID

List integrations for your API and find the one related to your `getUser` route.

```powershell
$Integrations = aws apigatewayv2 get-integrations --api-id $ApiId | ConvertFrom-Json
$GetUserIntegration = $Integrations.Items | Where-Object { $_.IntegrationId -eq $GetUserRouteDetails.TargetIntegrationId }
$GetUserIntegrationId = $GetUserIntegration.IntegrationId
```

### Step 4: Inspect Integration Responses for `getUser`

Finally, use the integration ID to inspect the integration responses and verify if CORS headers are correctly set up.

```powershell
$IntegrationResponses = aws apigatewayv2 get-integration-responses --api-id $ApiId --integration-id $GetUserIntegrationId | ConvertFrom-Json
$IntegrationResponses.Items | ForEach-Object { $_.ResponseParameters }
```

### Combining Steps for Streamlined Execution

For a more streamlined approach, you can combine these steps into a single PowerShell script or command sequence. The goal is to inspect the route and integration details, focusing on the response parameters where CORS headers would be specified.

Remember, these commands assume that you have the AWS CLI installed and configured to work with PowerShell, and that your user has the necessary permissions to query API Gateway configurations.

### Posting Results Back

After running these commands, you should have detailed information about the CORS configuration for your `getUser` route and related integration. You can post the output directly here, especially looking for anything under `ResponseParameters` that would indicate CORS headers like `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`, and so on.

If any CORS-related headers are missing or incorrectly specified, you'll need to adjust your API Gateway settings accordingly and redeploy your API for the changes to take effect.

---

**User** _at 6:14 pm, Jul 1, 2024_

That didn't return anything. I just remembered that the AWS CLI has a `--query` feature which allows the use of `jq` syntax. That is probably a more straightforward way of constructing these queries. Can you use that instead?

---

**Codeium** _at 6:14 pm, Jul 1, 2024_

Absolutely, using the AWS CLI `--query` parameter with JMESPath query syntax can streamline extracting specific information. If you're looking to inspect the CORS settings for your `getUser` route in API Gateway, you can use the `--query` option to directly filter the output of your AWS CLI commands.

### Step 1: Find the Route ID for `getUser`

First, find the route ID for the `getUser` route. This command filters the routes to find one with the specified path and extracts the route ID.

```sh
aws apigatewayv2 get-routes --api-id <api-id> --query "Items[?Path==`/getUser`].RouteId" --output text
```

### Step 2: Inspect the `getUser` Route Details

Given the route ID from Step 1, you can directly inspect the route's details, including its integration ID.

```sh
aws apigatewayv2 get-route --api-id <api-id> --route-id <route-id> --query "TargetIntegrationId" --output text
```

### Step 3: List Integration Responses for the Route's Integration

With the integration ID obtained from Step 2, you can inspect the integration responses, focusing on the response parameters where CORS headers would be specified.

```sh
aws apigatewayv2 get-integration-responses --api-id <api-id> --integration-id <integration-id> --query "Items[].ResponseParameters" --output text
```

### Combining Steps with PowerShell for Streamlined Execution

You can combine these steps in PowerShell to automate the process. Here's how you could do it, assuming you replace `<api-id>` with your actual API Gateway API ID:

```powershell
$ApiId = "<api-id>" # Replace with your API ID
$RouteId = aws apigatewayv2 get-routes --api-id $ApiId --query "Items[?Path==`/getUser`].RouteId" --output text
$IntegrationId = aws apigatewayv2 get-route --api-id $ApiId --route-id $RouteId --query "TargetIntegrationId" --output text
$ResponseParameters = aws apigatewayv2 get-integration-responses --api-id $ApiId --integration-id $IntegrationId --query "Items[].ResponseParameters" --output text

$ResponseParameters
```

This combined PowerShell script automatically finds the `getUser` route ID, then uses that to find the integration ID for the route, and finally lists the integration responses, specifically looking at the response parameters.

### Note

- Ensure that you have the correct permissions set up for your AWS CLI session to execute these commands.
- Replace placeholder `<api-id>` with your actual API Gateway API ID.
- If any step fails to return data, check that each identifier is correct and that the route/integration indeed exists as expected.

Using the `--query` option can significantly reduce the complexity of filtering and extracting specific data from the AWS CLI command outputs, making it easier to find and verify your API Gateway's CORS configurations.

```

And when I try to use that whole string for the `--route-id` I get an error

**Codeium** _at 6:21 pm, Jul 1, 2024_

The output you received indicates multiple route IDs, which suggests there are multiple routes associated with the `getUser` path or a similar issue. This is unusual since typically a specific path like `/getUser` should correspond to a single route ID in API Gateway. It's possible there might be a misunderstanding or misconfiguration.

Given this situation, you should individually inspect each route ID to determine which one is actually associated with the `getUser` operation you're trying to configure or inspect for CORS settings. Here's how you could proceed, step by step, to handle multiple route IDs:

### Step 1: Validate and Identify the Correct Route ID

You can manually inspect each route ID to find the correct one associated with your `getUser` endpoint. You'll need to run the `get-route` command for each route ID to see its details. Since manually checking each one can be tedious, you might start with the first ID and see if it corresponds to the `getUser` operation you're interested in:

```pwsh
$ApiId = "<api-id>" # Replace with your actual API ID
$RouteIds = @("68t92c2", "6l5gwm3", "bkzrw7n", "s10qrh8") # Replace with the actual route IDs you received

foreach ($RouteId in $RouteIds) {
    $RouteDetails = aws apigatewayv2 get-route --api-id $ApiId --route-id $RouteId | ConvertFrom-Json
    Write-Output "Route ID: $RouteId"
    Write-Output "Route Details: $RouteDetails"
}
```

Replace `<api-id>` with your actual API Gateway API ID and adjust the `$RouteIds` array with the route IDs you received. This script will print details for each route ID, allowing you to manually identify the one that corresponds to your `getUser` operation.

### Step 2: Once You Identify the Correct Route ID

After identifying the correct route ID associated with the `getUser` endpoint, proceed with inspecting its integration and CORS settings as previously described:

1. **Get the integration ID for the route**:
    ```sh
    aws apigatewayv2 get-route --api-id <api-id> --route-id <correct-route-id> --query "TargetIntegrationId" --output text
    ```

2. **Inspect integration responses** for CORS headers:
    ```sh
    aws apigatewayv2 get-integration-responses --api-id <api-id> --integration-id <integration-id> --query "Items[].ResponseParameters" --output text
    ```

### Note on Handling Multiple Route IDs

- It's unusual for a path to have multiple route IDs unless they are associated with different HTTP methods or represent different stages or configurations. Ensure your API Gateway configuration is as expected and that there isn't an unintended duplication of routes.
- If your API Gateway setup intentionally involves multiple routes for the `getUser` path (e.g., handling different methods), you'll need to inspect each one to configure CORS appropriately for your use case.

This approach should help you identify the correct route ID and proceed with your CORS configuration troubleshooting.

**User** _at 6:28 pm, Jul 1, 2024_

I get this:

```powershell
 aws apigatewayv2 get-route --api-id $ApiId --route-id s10qrh8 --query "TargetIntegrationId" --output text  
None
```

That is before the last command. I didn't get to the last command.

---

**Codeium** _at 6:29 pm, Jul 1, 2024_

The response `None` for the `TargetIntegrationId` when querying the route details suggests that the specific route (`s10qrh8`) does not have an integration associated with it. This could happen for a few reasons:

1. **The route is not correctly configured**: It's possible that during the setup of your API Gateway, this route was created but not fully configured with an integration to a backend service (like a Lambda function, another HTTP endpoint, etc.).

2. **Temporary or incomplete setup**: If you were in the process of configuring your API and haven't yet associated an integration with this route, you might see this result.

Given this, you have a couple of options:

### If the Route Should Have an Integration

If `s10qrh8` is indeed the correct route ID for your `getUser` endpoint and it should have an integration, you'll need to go back to your API Gateway configuration (either in the AWS Management Console or via the AWS CDK/CLI) and ensure that an integration is properly set up for this route.

### If Another Route ID Should Be Used

Considering you obtained multiple route IDs initially, it's possible that another route ID corresponds to the `getUser` endpoint with the correct integration configured. You might need to inspect each of the other route IDs to find the one that is properly set up with an integration.

### Verifying and Setting Up Integrations

To verify or set up an integration for a route in the AWS Management Console, you can follow these steps:

- Navigate to the Amazon API Gateway console.
- Select your API.
- Under "Develop", find "Routes".
- Select the route by its ID or path.
- Check if there's an integration set up. If not, you can set one up by specifying the backend service (e.g., Lambda function) you want to trigger when the route is accessed.

If you're using the AWS CLI or CDK, ensure that your configuration scripts correctly associate the route with an integration. In the CLI, this typically involves creating an integration with `create-integration` and then associating it with a route using `update-route`.

### Next Steps

Once you've verified or corrected the integration for your route, you can proceed with any additional steps needed for your configuration, such as setting CORS headers or testing the endpoint.

If you find that the correct route is the one without an integration (`s10qrh8`), and you've updated it to include an integration, you might then retrieve the `TargetIntegrationId` again and proceed with checking the integration responses for CORS settings as needed.

**User** _at 6:30 pm, Jul 1, 2024_

This is the unfiltered route info:

```yml
 aws apigatewayv2 get-route --api-id $ApiId --route-id s10qrh8 
- ApiKeyRequired: false
 AuthorizationType: NONE
 RequestModels: {}
 RouteId: s10qrh8
 RouteKey: GET /getUser
 Target: integrations/hlb9q1i
```

---

**Codeium** _at 6:31 pm, Jul 1, 2024_

Given the unfiltered route information you've provided, it shows that the route with ID `s10qrh8` for the `GET /getUser` operation does indeed have an associated integration, identified by `Target: integrations/hlb9q1i`. The `Target` field specifies the integration ID (`hlb9q1i`) that's associated with this route.

The earlier command that returned `None` for the `TargetIntegrationId` might have been due to a misunderstanding of the query or a mistake in the command execution. The correct value for the integration ID, as per your unfiltered route info, is `hlb9q1i`.

### Next Steps

With the correct integration ID in hand (`hlb9q1i`), you can now proceed to inspect the integration responses to ensure that CORS headers are properly configured. Use the following AWS CLI command to check the integration responses for the `getUser` route's integration:

```sh
aws apigatewayv2 get-integration-responses --api-id $ApiId --integration-id hlb9q1i --query "Items[].ResponseParameters" --output text
```

This command will list the response parameters for the integration, where you should look for CORS-related headers such as `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`, and `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`.

### If CORS Headers Need to Be Added or Updated

If the CORS headers are not present or need to be modified, you will need to manually add or update them. Since the AWS CLI does not directly allow you to modify response parameters through a simple update command, you would typically manage CORS by either:

1. **Modifying the Integration Response through the AWS Management Console**: Navigate to your API Gateway's integration response settings and add or update the necessary CORS headers.

2. **Recreating the Integration Response with the Correct CORS Headers**: If you prefer to use the AWS CLI or your deployment process requires scripting, you may need to delete and recreate the integration response with the correct CORS headers included.

Remember, the precise steps for adding or updating the CORS headers can vary depending on whether you're using HTTP APIs or REST APIs in API Gateway, as the configuration and capabilities differ slightly between these types.

The information you've provided should be sufficient to inspect and adjust your CORS configuration as needed to resolve the issues you're encountering with your `GET /getUser` endpoint.

**Codeium** _at 6:36 pm, Jul 1, 2024_

Given the discrepancy between the AWS CLI output and what you're seeing in the AWS Management Console, it appears there may be a misunderstanding or a limitation in how the CLI command is being interpreted or executed. The CLI command you ran:

```powershell
aws apigatewayv2 get-integration-responses --api-id $ApiId --integration-id hlb9q1i
```

Returned `Items: []`, indicating no integration responses were found for that specific integration. However, seeing the integration details in the AWS Management Console confirms the integration exists but does not clarify why the integration responses aren't listed via the CLI.

### Understanding Integration Responses

For HTTP APIs in API Gateway, the concept of integration responses is handled differently compared to REST APIs. Specifically, HTTP APIs use the concept of integration response and route response less prominently, focusing more on direct integration with the backend service (like a Lambda function) and defining response behavior within the service itself or through route settings.

Given this, the AWS CLI command you used might not return detailed integration response settings because HTTP APIs manage these settings differently than REST APIs. This discrepancy can lead to confusion when expecting similar behavior between the two types of APIs.

### CORS Configuration for HTTP APIs

Since you're working with an HTTP API and concerned about CORS settings, remember that CORS for HTTP APIs is typically managed at the API level (not at the individual integration or route response level) through the CORS configuration settings when you create or update the API. This is consistent with the code snippet you showed earlier from your `cdk-stack.ts` file:

```typescript
// Define the HTTP API
const httpApi = new HttpApi(this, 'HandTermApi', {
    apiName: 'HandTermService',
    description: 'This service serves authentication requests.',
    // CORS configuration if needed
    corsPreflight: {
        allowOrigins: ['http://localhost:5173', 'https://handterm.com'],
        allowMethods: [CorsHttpMethod.GET, CorsHttpMethod.POST, CorsHttpMethod.OPTIONS],
        allowHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization'],
        allowCredentials: true,
    },
});
```

### Next Steps

Given the details you've shared:

1. **Verify CORS Settings at the API Level**: Since you're working with an HTTP API, ensure that the CORS settings at the API level are correctly configured to match your requirements. This includes allowed origins, methods, headers, and credentials.

2. **Redeploy the API**: Changes to the API, including CORS configurations, may require redeployment to take effect. Ensure that after updating your CORS settings or any other configurations, you redeploy the API.

3. **Test Endpoints After Redeployment**: After redeployment, test your endpoint again from the client application to see if the CORS issue is resolved.

4. **Review Lambda Function Integration**: Ensure that the Lambda function (`HandTermCdkStack-GetUserFunctionD3D353B4-q2BRCfPiy27i`) is configured to return the necessary CORS headers in its response if your client-side application requires them.

By focusing on the API-level CORS configuration and ensuring your backend service (Lambda function) is prepared to handle CORS correctly, you should be able to resolve the CORS issues you're experiencing with your `GET /getUser` endpoint.

**User** _at 6:40 pm, Jul 1, 2024_

Let's skip to the "Test Endpoints After Redeployment", because as I've said many times, I've already redeployed.

But let's not even worry about whether I redeployed. Lets just query the server settings directly. Let's focus on doing that the right way, instead of infinitely redeploying every time our query is wrong.

How can we query the server properly?

---

**Codeium** _at 6:40 pm, Jul 1, 2024_

To directly query your API Gateway's CORS configuration and ensure it matches your expectations without relying on redeployments or manual checks in the AWS Management Console, you can use the AWS CLI specifically targeted at your HTTP API's CORS settings. Since you're working with an HTTP API, the command you need focuses on retrieving the CORS configuration for your API.

### Querying HTTP API CORS Configuration

For HTTP APIs, CORS settings are configured at the API level, not per route or integration. You can use the following AWS CLI command to get the CORS configuration for your HTTP API:

```sh
aws apigatewayv2 get-cors --api-id <your-api-id>
```

Replace `<your-api-id>` with the actual ID of your API.

This command will return the CORS configuration for your API, showing you exactly what origins, methods, headers, etc., are allowed according to the current API setup.

### Example

If your API ID were `a1b2c3d4e5`, the command would look like this:

```sh
aws apigatewayv2 get-cors --api-id a1b2c3d4e5
```

### Expected Output

The output will be in JSON format and might look something like this if CORS is properly configured:

```json
{
    "AllowOrigins": ["http://localhost:5173", "https://handterm.com"],
    "AllowMethods": ["GET", "OPTIONS", "POST"],
    "AllowHeaders": ["Content-Type", "Authorization"],
    "AllowCredentials": true,
    ...
}
```

This output directly reflects the CORS settings applied to your HTTP API, allowing you to verify that they match your intended configuration without needing to interpret the settings through deployed behavior or manual inspection in the management console.

### Next Steps After Verification

- **If the CORS settings are as expected**, but you're still facing issues, the problem might lie elsewhere, such as with the client-side code, how the browser is handling the CORS policy, or potentially with the responses from your backend service (e.g., ensuring your Lambda function includes the necessary CORS headers in its responses if it's overriding the default CORS behavior of API Gateway).

- **If the CORS settings are not as expected**, you'll need to update them. You can use the `update-cors` command in the AWS CLI to modify the CORS configuration for your HTTP API. After making changes, ensure your API is redeployed if necessary (though changes to CORS settings for HTTP APIs are typically effective immediately).

This approach allows you to directly inspect and verify the server-side CORS configuration for your HTTP API, ensuring that it matches your requirements and helping to isolate the issue if CORS errors persist.

There is no `get-cors`. Maybe you meant to say `get-api`?

```pwsh
 aws apigatewayv2 get-api --api-id $ApiId

```

**Codeium** _at 6:45 pm, Jul 1, 2024_

You're right; I misspoke earlier. The correct way to examine the CORS configuration for an HTTP API in AWS API Gateway using the AWS CLI is through the `get-api` command, as you've done. This command retrieves information about your API, including the CORS configuration, as part of the API's details. Your command and its output correctly show the CORS settings applied to your HTTP API:

```yaml
ApiEndpoint: https://x7jzrjfuv8.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
ApiId: x7jzrjfuv8
ApiKeySelectionExpression: $request.header.x-api-key
CorsConfiguration:
  AllowCredentials: true
  AllowHeaders:
  - content-type
  - authorization
  AllowMethods:
  - GET
  - POST
  - OPTIONS
  AllowOrigins:
  - http://localhost:5173
  - https://handterm.com
CreatedDate: '2024-07-01T18:52:56+00:00'
Description: This service serves authentication requests.
DisableExecuteApiEndpoint: false
Name: HandTermService
ProtocolType: HTTP
RouteSelectionExpression: $request.method $request.path
```

This output confirms that CORS is configured for your API with the settings you intended:

- **AllowOrigins**: Includes both `http://localhost:5173` and `https://handterm.com`, indicating that your API is configured to accept requests from these origins.
- **AllowMethods**: Specifies that `GET`, `POST`, and `OPTIONS` methods are allowed, which covers the typical requirements for a RESTful API.
- **AllowHeaders**: Includes `content-type` and `authorization`, which are common headers needed for API requests, especially those involving authentication or content negotiation.
- **AllowCredentials**: Is set to true, allowing credentials to be included in cross-origin requests. This is often necessary for APIs that require authentication.

Given this configuration, if you're still encountering CORS errors, consider the following troubleshooting steps:

1. **Client-Side Request Configuration**: Ensure that the client-side code making requests to your API is configured correctly. This includes setting the `Origin` header correctly and respecting the allowed methods and headers.

2. **Response Headers from Backend**: If your backend (e.g., a Lambda function) is explicitly setting response headers, ensure it includes the necessary CORS headers. This is particularly important if your backend might override the default CORS behavior defined by API Gateway.

3. **Browser Caching**: Browsers can cache CORS policies, so if you've recently changed your CORS settings, ensure you test with cleared cache or in incognito mode to avoid seeing cached results.

4. **Proxy Servers or CDNs**: If your API requests pass through any proxies or CDN services, ensure they aren't stripping or modifying necessary CORS headers.

5. **Method-Level CORS Configuration**: For REST APIs (less applicable in your case but worth mentioning for completeness), CORS can be configured at the method level, which could override global settings.

Your method of directly querying the server settings via `get-api` successfully retrieves the current CORS configuration, streamlining the process of verifying server-side settings without unnecessary redeployments.

**User** _at 6:53 pm, Jul 1, 2024_

I just tried it from Incognito Mode, so it's not the cache.

I would like to focus on your suggestion: "Client-Side Request Configuration: Ensure that the client-side code making requests to your API is configured correctly. This includes setting the Origin header correctly and respecting the allowed methods and headers."

I'm using this:

```ts
const config = {
 headers: {
  "Content-Type": "application/json",
  "WithCredentials": "true",
 }
}
```

And this:

```ts
 const getUser = async () => {
  try {
   const response = await axios.get(`${API_URL}${ENDPOINTS.api.GetUser}`, config);
   return response.data; // Contains username, attributes, etc.
  } catch (error) {
   console.error('Error fetching current user:', error);
   return null;
  }
 };
```

Is that missing something?

**Codeium** _at 6:53 pm, Jul 1, 2024_

Based on the client-side request configuration you've shared, there's a slight adjustment needed. The `axios` configuration option for sending credentials in cross-origin requests is `withCredentials`, not `"WithCredentials"`. It's also important to note that `withCredentials` should be a boolean value, not a string, and it should be outside of the `headers` object in the `axios` request configuration. Let's correct this configuration:

```typescript
const config = {
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  withCredentials: true, // Correctly positioned and boolean value
};
```

Then, when making the request:

```typescript
const getUser = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get(`${API_URL}${ENDPOINTS.api.GetUser}`, config);
    return response.data; // Contains username, attributes, etc.
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching current user:', error);
    return null;
  }
};
```

### Explanation:

- **`"Content-Type": "application/json"`**: This header is correctly set for JSON requests. It informs the server that the client is sending (in POST/PUT requests) or expects to receive (in GET requests) data in JSON format.
- **`withCredentials: true`**: This setting is crucial for requests that need to include cookies, authorization headers, or TLS client certificates in cross-origin requests. Setting `withcredentials` to `true` tells `axios` to send the cookies from the origin (your site) with the request to the server. Since your server configuration (`AllowCredentials: true`) allows credentials for cross-origin requests, this client configuration is necessary to match that policy.

Make sure that your server is configured to accept requests with credentials and from the specific origin you're working with. Since the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` cannot be '*' (wildcard) when `withCredentials` is true, it must explicitly specify the requesting origin (`http://localhost:5173` in your case) in the response headers.

By adjusting this configuration, you align the client-side request with the CORS policy and requirements set on the server-side, which should help in addressing the CORS error you're encountering.

The change in the error message from a CORS issue to a `500 (Internal Server Error)` suggests that the CORS configuration is no longer blocking the request, but now there's an issue on the server-side causing it to fail.

A `500 Internal Server Error` is a general HTTP status code that means something has gone wrong on the web server hosting the application, but the server could not be more specific on what the exact problem is.

### Steps to Diagnose and Resolve the Issue:

1. **Check Server Logs**: The first step in diagnosing a `500 Internal Server Error` is to check the server-side logs. Since your backend is likely an AWS Lambda function (given the `Integration details for route` you shared earlier), you should check the CloudWatch Logs for the Lambda function. Look for any errors or exceptions in the logs that correspond to the time you made the request. This can provide specific details on what went wrong.

2. **Review Backend Code**: Given that the issue is now on the server side, review the code for the Lambda function handling the `/getUser` endpoint. Ensure there are no unhandled exceptions or code paths that could result in an error response. Common issues include:
   - Problems with external dependencies or services the Lambda function interacts with.
   - Errors in the logic processing the request.
   - Issues connecting to databases or other AWS services (e.g., permissions issues, incorrect configuration).

3. **Validate Request Handling**: Ensure the Lambda function is correctly parsing and handling the incoming request, especially if the request includes JSON data or requires specific headers. Also, confirm that the Lambda function is correctly returning a response in the format expected by API Gateway.

4. **Check Configuration and Permissions**: Ensure that the Lambda function has the necessary permissions to perform its operations, especially if it's accessing other AWS resources. Use the IAM (Identity and Access Management) console to verify the role and policies attached to the Lambda function.

5. **Test Locally or in Isolation**: If possible, test the Lambda function locally or in isolation (e.g., using the AWS Lambda console's test feature) to see if you can reproduce the error. This can help isolate the problem from the API Gateway and focus on the function's code.

6. **Deploy and Test Incremental Changes**: If you make changes to your backend code or configuration, deploy these changes incrementally and test after each change to identify what resolves the issue.

### Final Thoughts:

The shift from a CORS error to a server-side error indicates progress in troubleshooting but highlights the importance of robust error handling and logging on the server side. By following the steps outlined above, you should be able to identify and resolve the root cause of the `500 Internal Server Error`.
