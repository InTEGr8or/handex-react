**User** _at 9:05 am, Jul 3, 2024_

I want to exit a function if the current user is not logged in, but the `getUser()` is async.

I have:

```ts
  if(!(await this.props.auth.getUser())) return false;
```

what am I doing wrong? Actually, what is the best way to do this?

To properly handle asynchronous operations like `await` within a function, the function itself must be declared as `async`. This allows you to use `await` to wait for promises to resolve inside the function. From the snippet you've shared, it looks like you're trying to use `await` without the function being declared as `async`.

If the function you're trying to add this logic to is not an `async` function, you will encounter syntax errors or unexpected behavior because `await` can only be used inside `async` functions.

Given the context and your description, here's how you can modify your function to properly handle the asynchronous `getUser` method:

1. Declare your function as `async` if it's not already. This will allow you to use `await` within the function.
2. Use the `await` keyword before `this.props.auth.getUser()` to wait for the promise to resolve.
3. Based on the resolved value, you can then decide whether to exit the function or continue executing the rest of the code.

Here's an example restructuring based on the common usage pattern in a React component:

```tsx
async someFunction() {
  // Assuming this.props.auth.getUser() is an async function and returns null or user object
  if (!(await this.props.auth.getUser())) {
    console.log('User not logged in, exiting function');
    return false; // Exit the function if no user is logged in
  }

  // Continue with the function if user is logged in
  console.log('User is logged in, continuing execution');
  // Rest of your code goes here
}
```

Remember, if this method is an event handler or tied to a lifecycle method in a class component, making it `async` could have implications on how you handle the event or lifecycle operation, since the method will now return a promise. Always ensure the async behavior is compatible with how the function is being used within your component.

If the function you're modifying is part of a larger flow that cannot be made asynchronous for some reason, you'll need to use promise syntax with `.then()` and `.catch()` to handle the asynchronous operation without `await`. However, based on your scenario, converting the function to `async` and using `await` seems to be the straightforward approach.

The function being called is declared as async, but it is in another module in a React project.

```ts
 const getUser = async () => {
  try {
   // Make the request with the Access Token
   const response = await axios.get(`${API_URL}${ENDPOINTS.api.GetUser}`, getAuthConfig());
   return response.data; // Contains username, attributes, etc.
  } catch (error) {
   console.error('Error fetching current user:', error);
   return null;
  }
 };
```

It's exported like this:

```ts
 return { isLoggedIn, login: signIn, logout: signOut, signUp, refreshSession, getUser, checkSession, changePassword, setUser, saveLog, getLog, listLog };
```

And it is imported as a `prop` in the module it is being called from:

```ts
export interface IHandTermProps {
 // Define the interface for your HandexTerm logic
 terminalWidth: number;
 auth: {
  login: (username: string, password: string, callback: (error: any, result: any) => void) => void;
  logout: () => void;
  isLoggedIn: boolean;
  signUp: (
   username: string,
   password: string,
   email: string,
   callback: (error: any, result: any) => void
  ) => void;
  getUser: () => any;
  setUser: (profile: string) => void;
  saveLog: (key: string, content: string) => void;
  changePassword: (
   oldPassword: string,
   newPassword: string,
   callback: (error: any, result: any) => void
  ) => void;
  // Add other properties returned by useAuth here
 };
}
```

Given your setup and the details provided, it seems like you are correctly defining and importing the `getUser` function. However, the issue arises in how you're trying to use this function within a context that requires synchronous execution, specifically when you're checking if the user is logged in and wish to exit the function immediately if not.

The correct approach would be to ensure that any function calling `await this.props.auth.getUser()` itself must be an `async` function. Since you're using this within a class component, it's important to remember that React lifecycle methods (like `render`, `componentDidMount`, etc.) cannot be marked as `async` because React expects these methods to return specific types of values synchronously.

If you're calling `this.props.auth.getUser()` from a custom method within your class component, you can make that method `async` and use `await` as you've shown. Here's an example modification to fit your scenario:

```tsx
// Assuming this is a method within your React class component
async checkUserAndDoSomething() {
  if (!(await this.props.auth.getUser())) {
    console.log('No user logged in, exiting...');
    return false;
  }

  // User is logged in, proceed with the rest of the function
  console.log('User is logged in, continuing...');
  // The rest of your code here
}
```

Remember, calling this `async` method won't directly affect the rendering logic since `async` functions return a Promise. If you are trying to conditionally render something based on whether the user is logged in, you should manage this state (`isLoggedIn`) within your component's state and use `componentDidMount` or `useEffect` (in functional components) to set this state once the user data is fetched. Here’s a quick example of how you might initiate this check in a class component's lifecycle method and update the component's state accordingly:

```tsx
componentDidMount() {
  this.checkUserAndDoSomething().then(isLoggedIn => {
    if (isLoggedIn) {
      // Update the component state or perform actions based on user being logged in
    }
  });
}
```

This ensures that your component properly handles the asynchronous nature of fetching user data while maintaining compatibility with React's lifecycle expectations.

I want to include this `cdk/lambda/cdkshared/entpoints.ts` in my CDK Lambda directory:

```ts
export const ENDPOINTS = {
  aws: {
    cognito: {
      url: 'https://cognito-idp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com',
    },
    s3: {
      url: 'https://s3.amazonaws.com',
      bucketName: 'handterm',
    },
  },
  api: {
    BaseUrl: 'https://x7jzrjfuv8.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com',
    SignUp: '/signUp',
    GetLog: '/getLog',
    ListLog: '/listLog',
    SaveLog: '/saveLog',
    SignIn: '/signIn',
    SignOut: '/signOut',
    ChangePassword: '/changePassword',
    TokenHandler: '/tokenHandler',
    RefreshSession: '/refreshSession',
    CheckSession: '/checkSession',
    GetUser: '/getUser',
    SetUser: '/setUser',
  }
} as const
```

I know I could probably put this into Parameter Store or something, but I think I should be able to put these right into the CDK Lambda code directory, or include it in the `Layers`, right? 

What is the more standard and effective way of doing this?

---

**Codeium** _at 10:14 am, Jul 3, 2024_

Including configuration data like endpoints directly in your AWS CDK Lambda code or as a part of a Lambda Layer are both valid approaches, depending on your specific needs and how you manage your application's configuration data. Let's explore the advantages and considerations of each method:

### 1. **Direct Inclusion in Lambda Code**
By placing the `endpoints.ts` file directly in your Lambda's code directory, you make it part of the deployment package. This method is straightforward and ensures that your Lambda function has immediate access to these constants without any additional setup.

- **Advantages**:
  - Simple to implement and requires no additional AWS services.
  - Changes to endpoints require redeployment of your Lambda, which can be beneficial for ensuring consistency across your environment.

- **Considerations**:
  - Each Lambda function needs its own copy of `endpoints.ts`, which could lead to duplication if many functions use the same endpoints.
  - Updating endpoints requires redeployment of your Lambda functions.

To use this method, you would typically import the `endpoints.ts` file directly in your Lambda function's code:

```typescript
import { ENDPOINTS } from './path/to/cdk/lambda/cdkshared/endpoints';
```

### 2. **Using Lambda Layers**
Lambda Layers allow you to manage your function's code and libraries in a more modular way. By putting your `endpoints.ts` (or a compiled version if your runtime does not support TypeScript natively) in a Layer, you can share this across multiple Lambda functions.

- **Advantages**:
  - Reduces duplication by allowing multiple Lambda functions to share the same Layer.
  - Updating the Layer with new endpoints does not require changes to the function's code, only redeployment with the updated Layer.

- **Considerations**:
  - Requires additional setup to create and manage Layers.
  - Layers are immutable once published; updates require creating a new version.
  - You need to ensure that the Layer's runtime is compatible with your Lambda function's runtime.

To implement this, you'd create a Layer in AWS CDK and add it to your Lambda function:

```typescript
import * as lambda from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda';

const myLayer = new lambda.LayerVersion(this, 'MyLayer', {
  code: lambda.Code.fromAsset('path/to/layer/code'),
  compatibleRuntimes: [lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_14_X],
  description: 'A layer containing shared endpoints',
});

const myFunction = new lambda.Function(this, 'MyFunction', {
  code: lambda.Code.fromAsset('path/to/function/code'),
  handler: 'index.handler',
  runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_14_X,
  layers: [myLayer],
});
```

### **Choosing the Best Approach**

- If your endpoints are unlikely to change often or you have a small number of Lambda functions, including `endpoints.ts` directly in your Lambda code might be simpler and more straightforward.
- If you anticipate frequent updates to your endpoints or you have multiple Lambda functions needing access to the same configuration data, using Lambda Layers could be more efficient and manageable in the long run.

Regardless of the approach, consider using environment variables for any sensitive information or for information that might change frequently or vary between different environments (development, staging, production). This can complement the use of `endpoints.ts` or Lambda Layers by providing a flexible way to override specific values without code changes.

My Lambda functions are part of an API Gateway HTTP API. All the Lambda code ends up in one directory on the server, but the `import { ENDPOINTS } from '../cdkshared/endpoints';` does not include that file into the HTTP API directory and the server reports an error for the missing file.

---

**Codeium** _at 10:18 am, Jul 3, 2024_

When deploying AWS Lambda functions as part of an API Gateway HTTP API with AWS CDK, and your Lambda functions need to share common code or configuration like an `endpoints.ts` file, it's important to ensure that the shared resources are correctly included in the deployment package of each Lambda function.

Given the error you're encountering, it seems that the shared `endpoints.ts` file is not being bundled with your Lambda's deployment package. This can happen for a couple of reasons, such as the build process not correctly including files outside the Lambda function's directory, or the CDK not being configured to include the shared file.

### Solution Approaches

#### **1. Adjusting Your Build Process**

If you're using a build tool (like `tsc` for TypeScript or `webpack`), ensure it's configured to include or copy the shared `endpoints.ts` file into each Lambda function's build directory before deployment. This might involve modifying your `tsconfig.json` or `webpack.config.js` to explicitly include or copy files from outside the standard source paths.

For TypeScript, you might need to adjust your `tsconfig.json` to ensure it includes the shared directory, something like:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "./built",
    "rootDir": "./",
    "include": ["../cdkshared/**/*", "./**/*"]
  }
}
```

For Webpack, you could use the `CopyWebpackPlugin` to copy the shared file into your build output directory:

```js
const CopyPlugin = require('copy-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    new CopyPlugin({
      patterns: [
        { from: 'path/to/cdkshared/endpoints.ts', to: 'dist' },
      ],
    }),
  ],
};
```

#### **2. Including Shared Code in Lambda Layers**

As previously discussed, another approach is to use Lambda Layers for shared code. However, this requires the Lambda runtime to support your specific file format (e.g., JavaScript for Node.js runtimes). For TypeScript, you'll likely need a build step to compile to JavaScript first. 

#### **3. Explicitly Specifying Asset Paths in CDK**

Ensure that your CDK code for Lambda deployment specifies the right asset paths. If you're using individual directories for each function but need to include shared code, consider using a build step that copies the shared code into each function's directory before deployment or adjusts the asset path to include the necessary files.

```typescript
const lambdaFunction = new lambda.Function(this, 'MyFunction', {
  code: lambda.Code.fromAsset('path/to/lambda/directory', {
    // Example for bundling assets manually
    bundling: {
      image: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_14_X.bundlingImage,
      command: [
        'bash', '-c', [
          'cp -au ../cdkshared .',
          'npm install',
          'npm run build',
          'cp -au build/* /asset-output/'
        ].join(' && ')
      ],
    },
  }),
  runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_14_X,
  handler: 'index.handler',
});
```

### General Advice

- **Check Your Local Build**: Test locally by simulating the Lambda environment as closely as possible to ensure all necessary files are included.
- **Review CDK Synth Output**: Run `cdk synth` to generate the AWS CloudFormation template and see how your Lambda functions are being configured. This can give clues about the asset paths being used.
- **Logs and Debugging**: Use logs in your Lambda functions to debug which files are present in the Lambda execution environment. This can help identify missing files or incorrect paths.

Adjusting your build process to ensure shared resources are included in each Lambda's deployment package or using Lambda Layers for shared code are effective ways to solve the problem of missing shared files in a serverless environment.

Is there a way to just include the `import { ENDPOINTS } from '../lambda/cdkshared/endpoints';` file into the HTTP API folder on the server?

Given your CDK setup and the need to include the `endpoints.ts` file directly into your Lambda functions' deployment package, there are a few strategies you can employ. However, it's important to remember that the AWS CDK doesn't directly manipulate files within Lambda functions or an HTTP API folder on the server in the way traditional web servers might allow you to add files to a directory. Instead, AWS CDK operates at a higher level, provisioning AWS resources and specifying the content of Lambda deployment packages.

Here are some approaches to ensure your `endpoints.ts` is included in your Lambda functions' deployment packages:

### 1. **Include the File in Each Lambda's Asset Directory**
The most straightforward way is to ensure that `endpoints.ts` is within the path that's specified in the `lambda.Code.fromAsset()` method for each Lambda function. This typically means placing a copy of `endpoints.ts` in the same directory as your Lambda function code or in a shared directory that's included when you specify the path in `fromAsset()`.

Since your Lambda functions are located in '`lambda/authentication`' and '`lambda/userStorage`', you'll need to ensure `endpoints.ts` is accessible from these directories. If duplicating the file isn't desirable, consider the following:

### 2. **Use a Build Tool to Bundle Your Lambda Functions**
A more scalable approach involves using a build tool like Webpack, Rollup, or TypeScript itself to compile and bundle your Lambda function code along with any dependencies (including `endpoints.ts`). This way, you can maintain a single copy of `endpoints.ts` and ensure it's bundled into the deployment package of each Lambda function that requires it.

For example, with TypeScript, you can adjust your `tsconfig.json` to include the shared directory, and then use the TypeScript compiler to output the bundled JS files to your Lambda directories before deploying with CDK.

### 3. **Custom CDK Asset Bundling**
AWS CDK supports custom bundling options for assets, allowing you to run a build script as part of the `lambda.Code.fromAsset()` call. This can be used to copy necessary files into your Lambda asset directories or to run a build process that includes them.

Here's an example of using CDK's bundling option:

```typescript
const lambdaFunction = new lambda.Function(this, 'MyFunction', {
  code: lambda.Code.fromAsset('path/to/lambda/directory', {
    bundling: {
      image: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_16_X.bundlingImage,
      command: [
        'bash', '-c', `
        cp ../lambda/cdkshared/endpoints.ts /asset-input,
        npm install,
        npm run build,
        cp -R . /asset-output/
        `
      ],
    },
  }),
  handler: 'index.handler',
  runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_16_X,
});
```

This example assumes you have a build script (`npm run build`) that compiles your TypeScript files, including `endpoints.ts`, into JavaScript. You would need to adjust the `command` to match your project's structure and build process.

### Conclusion
Each of these methods has its trade-offs in terms of complexity and maintainability. If your project and deployment processes are relatively simple, manually ensuring the `endpoints.ts` file is included in each Lambda's directory might suffice. However, for more complex setups or projects where DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles are important, using a build tool or CDK's custom bundling features will provide a more scalable solution.

When I look on the server, all the Lambda files are in the same directory.

Is there a way in the CDK to include a file that is not a Lambda function, but is used by the Lambda functions?

Yes, in AWS CDK, you can include non-Lambda files that are used by your Lambda functions by leveraging the bundling capabilities provided by the `lambda.Function` construct. This allows you to execute a custom build or copy command as part of the deployment process, ensuring that any required files or dependencies are included in the Lambda deployment package.

This approach is useful for including shared utility files, configurations, or any other resources your Lambda functions might depend on, without duplicating them across multiple directories.

### Using Bundling with CDK

Here's a more detailed look at how you can use the bundling option to include your `endpoints.ts` file in the Lambda deployment package. This example assumes you are using Node.js for your Lambda functions and TypeScript for your CDK scripts.

1. **Ensure Your Project Structure Supports Bundling**

First, make sure your project structure is organized in such a way that the bundling process can easily include the necessary files. For example:

```
project-root/
├── lib/
│   └── cdk-stack.ts      // Your CDK stack
└── lambda/
    ├── cdkshared/
    │   └── endpoints.ts  // Shared endpoints file
    └── authentication/
        └── handler.ts    // Example Lambda function
```

2. **Modify Your CDK Code to Use Bundling**

In your CDK stack (e.g., `cdk-stack.ts`), when you define a Lambda function, use the `bundling` option of the `lambda.Code.fromAsset()` method to include the `endpoints.ts` file. You can use a shell command to copy or build your Lambda function along with the shared file.

Here's an example of how to modify a Lambda function definition to include the `endpoints.ts` file via bundling:

```typescript
import * as lambda from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import * as path from 'path';

export class MyCdkStack extends Stack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);
    
    // Define the Lambda function with bundling to include 'endpoints.ts'
    const myLambda = new lambda.Function(this, 'MyFunction', {
      runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_14_X,
      handler: 'handler.main',
      code: lambda.Code.fromAsset(path.join(__dirname, '../lambda/authentication'), {
        bundling: {
          image: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_14_X.bundlingImage,
          command: [
            'bash', '-c', [
              'cp -au ../cdkshared .', // Adjust this command as necessary
              'npm install',
              'npm run build', // Your build command here, if applicable
              'cp -R . /asset-output/'
            ].join(' && ')
          ],
        },
      }),
    });
    
    // Other stack resources...
  }
}
```

### Notes:

- The `bundling.command` array specifies a shell command that runs inside the Docker container used for bundling. Adjust this command as needed to copy the `endpoints.ts` file or to run any build process you have.
- The example uses `cp -au ../cdkshared .` to copy the `cdkshared` directory (which contains `endpoints.ts`) into the asset staging directory. Ensure this command correctly reflects your project's directory structure.
- You may need to adjust the location of `endpoints.ts` and how it's imported in your Lambda function code, depending on how your build process compiles or transpiles your TypeScript code.

This approach allows you to maintain a single copy of `endpoints.ts` in your project, avoiding duplication while ensuring that it's included in the deployment package of any Lambda function that requires it.

So, would I just add that to a single Lambda in the CDK?

I have about ten lambdas and they all look like this, and they all end up in the same directory in the HTTP API and I can see them all in that directory in the AWS Web Console.

```ts
  const signUpLambda = new lambda.Function(this, 'SignUpFunction', {
   runtime: nodeRuntime,
   handler: 'signUp.handler',
   role: lambdaExecutionRole,
   code: lambda.Code.fromAsset('lambda/authentication', {
    bundling: {
     image: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_16_X.bundlingImage,
     command: [
       
     ]
    }
   }),
   environment: {
    COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_ID: userPoolClient.userPoolClientId,
   }
  });
```

Given that you have about ten Lambda functions and they all require access to the same `endpoints.ts` file, and considering these functions end up in the same directory when deployed, there are a couple of aspects to clarify and a recommended approach to handle this situation:

### Clarifications

1. **Lambda Functions in the Same Directory**: In AWS Lambda, each function is isolated and has its own deployment package. When you view them in the AWS Management Console, they appear as separate entities. If you're seeing all your functions "in the same directory" in the console, it might be a misunderstanding of how the AWS Management Console displays resources or how your build process packages these functions.

2. **Sharing Code Between Lambda Functions**: If multiple Lambda functions need to share code (like your `endpoints.ts`), each function's deployment package must include that shared code. AWS doesn't natively support sharing files between Lambda functions at runtime; each function's code package must be standalone.

### Recommended Approach

Given your setup, you should apply the bundling strategy to each Lambda function that requires access to the shared `endpoints.ts`. This ensures that each Lambda function's deployment package includes the necessary shared code.

You do not necessarily need to repeat the bundling configuration manually for each Lambda function in your CDK code. Instead, you can abstract the common configuration into a function or use a loop to apply it to each Lambda function. Here's an example of how to abstract the bundling configuration:

```typescript
function createLambdaFunction(scope: Construct, name: string, handler: string, role: iam.IRole) {
  return new lambda.Function(scope, name, {
    runtime: nodeRuntime,
    handler: handler,
    role: role,
    code: lambda.Code.fromAsset('lambda/authentication', {
      bundling: {
        image: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_16_X.bundlingImage,
        command: [
          'bash', '-c', [
            'npm install',
            `cp -au ../cdkshared .`, // Copy shared code
            'npm run build', // Build command, if applicable
            'cp -R . /asset-output/'
          ].join(' && ')
        ],
      }
    }),
    environment: {
      COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_ID: userPoolClient.userPoolClientId,
    }
  });
}

// Usage for each Lambda function
const signUpLambda = createLambdaFunction(this, 'SignUpFunction', 'signUp.handler', lambdaExecutionRole);
const signInLambda = createLambdaFunction(this, 'SignInFunction', 'signIn.handler', lambdaExecutionRole);
// Repeat for other Lambda functions as needed
```

This approach allows you to maintain a single source of truth for the bundling configuration and makes your CDK stack more maintainable, especially when multiple Lambda functions share similar configurations.

### Important Notes

- Adjust the `createLambdaFunction` function as needed to fit your specific requirements, such as different `runtime`, `code` paths, or additional properties for each Lambda function.
- Ensure the `cp -au ../cdkshared .` command correctly reflects the structure of your project and the relative path from where the Lambda code is located to the `cdkshared` directory. The exact command might vary based on your project's directory structure and the build environment.
