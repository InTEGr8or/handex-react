summary: The user was having trouble with a GitHub Pages deployment not updating after running a GitHub Actions workflow. The assistant provided troubleshooting steps related to GitHub Pages source settings, repository permissions, workflow branch triggers, workflow success, build directory, caching issues, and GitHub Pages propagation. The user found that deploying directly from the `gh-pages` branch worked, but using "GitHub Actions" as the deployment source did not. The assistant explained the differences between deploying from a branch and using GitHub Actions as the deployment source, suggesting ensuring the repository settings for GitHub Pages source are correctly configured.

This doesn't seem to do the deploy step.

The action runs, but the GitHub Pages still says:

```
Workflow details will appear here once your site has been deployed.Â View workflow runs.
```

Based on the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` snippet you provided, if the workflow runs without errors but the GitHub Pages site is not updating, you might want to check a few things:

1. **GitHub Pages Source Settings**: Ensure that GitHub Pages is set to serve the site from the correct branch and folder. It should be set to the `gh-pages` branch if you're using the `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3` action by default.

2. **Repository Permissions**: Confirm that the `GITHUB_TOKEN` has the necessary permissions. By default, the `GITHUB_TOKEN` that GitHub Actions provides should have sufficient permissions to push to the `gh-pages` branch.

3. **Workflow Branch Triggers**: Verify that the workflow is being triggered on the correct branches. Your workflow is configured to run on pushes to the `main` and `master` branches. If your default branch is different or if you push to a different branch, this workflow will not run.

4. **Workflow Success**: Check the Actions tab in your GitHub repository to see if the workflow completed successfully. Look for any failed steps in the workflow run.

5. **Build Directory**: Confirm that the `publish_dir` is set to the correct build output directory. For a Vite project, this is typically `./dist`, but it should match the output directory configured in your `vite.config.js`.

6. **Caching Issues**: It's also possible that there could be caching issues with your browser or a Content Delivery Network (CDN) if you're using one. Try clearing your browser cache or checking the site from an incognito window or a different browser.

7. **GitHub Pages Propagation**: Sometimes, it may take a few minutes for the changes to propagate and for the updated site to appear due to GitHub's internal caching.

If everything seems correct and the site is still not updating, you may want to add a step to your workflow to verify the contents of the `gh-pages` branch after the deployment step to ensure that the new build is actually being pushed.

Please check these potential issues, and if the problem persists, you might need to provide more details or review the workflow run logs for specific error messages that could indicate what the issue is.

It seems to work if I say "Deploy from a branch" and set the branch to `gh-pages`, but not if I set delopyment to "GitHub Actions".

If deploying from the `gh-pages` branch directly works, but selecting "GitHub Actions" as the deployment source does not, there are a couple of aspects to consider:

1. **Branch Configuration**: When you choose "Deploy from a branch" and set the branch to `gh-pages`, GitHub Pages serves the static files directly from that branch. This indicates that the `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3` action is successfully committing the build artifacts to the `gh-pages` branch.

2. **GitHub Actions Configuration**: When you select "GitHub Actions" as the deployment source, GitHub expects the workflow to handle the deployment process. This approach is typically used when you have a custom workflow that builds and deploys your site to a different source, such as a `docs` folder on the `main` branch.

Given that using the `gh-pages` branch directly works, it suggests that your workflow is correctly configured and the `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions are adequate.

To resolve the issue, ensure that in your repository settings, under the "Pages" section, the source is set to use the `gh-pages` branch and the `/ (root)` folder. Here's how you can check and update this setting:

- Go to your repository on GitHub.
- Click on "Settings" in the top bar.
- Scroll down to the "Pages" section.
- Under "Source", select "Branch: gh-pages" and "Folder: / (root)".
- Save the changes.

After applying these settings, the GitHub Pages site should be served using the `gh-pages` branch updated by your GitHub Actions workflow. If the "GitHub Actions" option is still not working, it may be a misunderstanding of the deployment source option, as the "GitHub Actions" option typically requires a different workflow configuration that doesn't apply to your current setup.
