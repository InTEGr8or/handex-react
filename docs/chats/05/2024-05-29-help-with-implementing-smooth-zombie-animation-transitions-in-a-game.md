summary: The user was seeking assistance on implementing a game logic where a zombie character switches between walking and attacking animations as it moves across the screen. Initially, the user encountered issues with the zombie getting stuck in attack mode. The assistant provided code snippets and suggestions to help the user smoothly transition the zombie character between walking and attacking animations at specific intervals. Subsequently, the user faced a glitch at the end of the attack animation, prompting further refinement of the code to reset the frame index when switching back to the walking animation. Overall, the chat focused on iterating and refining the game logic to ensure seamless animation transitions for the zombie character.

My game has a `Zombie4` walking across the screen from left to right. 

Every 20px I want the zombie to attak instead of walk. 

How do I do that?

In your `BaseCharacter.animate` method, you can check the position of the `Zombie4` character and switch the animation from walking to attacking whenever the zombie's x position is a multiple of 20. Here's how you could implement this logic:

```tsx
public animate(timestamp: number) {
  const sprite = this.sprites[this.currentAnimation];
  if (sprite && timestamp - this.lastFrameTime > this.frameDelay) {
    // Check if the zombie's x position is a multiple of 20 and if it's not already attacking
    if (this.position.x % 20 === 0 && this.currentAnimation !== ZombieActions.Attack) {
      this.currentAnimation = ZombieActions.Attack;
      this.frameIndex = 0; // Reset frame index for attack animation
    } else if (this.position.x % 20 !== 0 && this.currentAnimation !== ZombieActions.Walk) {
      this.currentAnimation = ZombieActions.Walk;
      this.frameIndex = 0; // Reset frame index for walk animation
    }
    
    // Update the frame index and position
    this.frameIndex = sprite.updateFrameIndex(this.frameIndex, timestamp, this.lastFrameTime, this.frameDelay);
    if (this.currentAnimation === ZombieActions.Walk) {
      this.position.x += this.velocity.x; // Continue moving the zombie
    }
    
    this.lastFrameTime = timestamp;
  }
}
```

This code changes the `currentAnimation` to attack when the zombie's x position is a multiple of 20 and it's not already attacking. When the zombie moves away from a position that is a multiple of 20, it switches back to walking. The frame index is reset whenever the animation changes to ensure the animation starts from the beginning.

Make sure that your sprite manager can handle switching between animations seamlessly when the `currentAnimation` changes. If the attack animation should play through completely before returning to walking, additional logic will be needed to track when the animation has finished.

Hmm..., that doesn't seem to move the zombie past the attack phase.

It attacks, but then it gets stuck in attack mode.

Based on the code snippet from `{BaseCharacter.tsx:BaseCharacter.animate}`, the issue seems to be that once the zombie enters the attack phase when `x` is a multiple of 20, there is no condition to exit the attack phase and resume walking. To address this, you could add a check to see if the attack animation has finished playing before switching back to the walk animation.

Here is a revised version of the `animate` method with an additional check to transition from attacking back to walking:

```tsx
public animate(timestamp: number) {
  const sprite = this.sprites[this.currentAnimation];
  if (sprite && timestamp - this.lastframeTime > this.frameDelay) {
    // Check if the zombie's x position is a multiple of 20 and if it's not already attacking
    if (this.position.x % 20 === 0 && this.currentAnimation !== ZombieActions.Attack) {
      this.currentAnimation = ZombieActions.Attack;
      this.frameIndex = 0; // Reset frame index for attack animation
    } else if (this.position.x % 20 !== 0 && this.currentAnimation !== ZombieActions.Walk) {
      this.currentAnimation = ZombieActions.Walk;
      this.frameIndex = 0; // Reset frame index for walk animation
    }
    
    // Update the frame index
    this.frameIndex = sprite.updateFrameIndex(this.frameIndex, timestamp, this.lastFrameTime, this.frameDelay);

    // If the attack animation has finished, switch back to walking
    if (this.currentAnimation === ZombieActions.Attack && this.frameIndex === sprite.frameCount - 1) {
      this.currentAnimation = ZombieActions.Walk;
    }

    // If the current animation is walk, continue moving the zombie
    if (this.currentAnimation === ZombieActions.Walk) {
      this.position.x += this.velocity.x;
    }

    this.lastFrameTime = timestamp;
  }
}
```

This code assumes that `sprite.frameCount` represents the total number of frames in the current animation. When the zombie is in the attack animation and the `frameIndex` reaches the last frame (`sprite.frameCount - 1`), it switches the current animation back to walking.

Please note that you'll need to ensure that `sprite.frameCount` or an equivalent way to determine the number of frames in the animation is available in your `Sprite` class. If not, you will need to add it or find another way to determine if the attack animation has finished.

That looks better, but there is a glitch at the end of the attack. There is no glitch at the start of the attack.

The glitch at the end of the attack animation could be due to the frame index not being reset when switching back to the walking animation. After the attack animation plays through completely and you switch the `currentAnimation` back to walking, you should also reset the `frameIndex` to ensure the walking animation starts from the first frame.

Here's the updated `animate` method with the additional reset of the `frameIndex` when the animation switches from attack back to walk:

```tsx
public animate(timestamp: number) {
  const sprite = this.sprites[this.currentAnimation];
  if (sprite && timestamp - this.lastFrameTime > this.frameDelay) {
    // Check if the zombie's x position is a multiple of 20 and if it's not already attacking
    if (this.position.x % 20 === 0 && this.currentAnimation !== ZombieActions.Attack) {
      this.currentAnimation = ZombieActions.Attack;
      this.frameIndex = 0; // Reset frame index for attack animation
    } else if (this.position.x % 20 !== 0 && this.currentAnimation !== ZombieActions.Walk) {
      this.currentAnimation = ZombieActions.Walk;
      this.frameIndex = 0; // Reset frame index for walk animation
    }
    
    // Update the frame index
    this.frameIndex = sprite.updateFrameIndex(this.frameIndex, timestamp, this.lastFrameTime, this.frameDelay);

    // If the attack animation has finished, switch back to walking and reset frame index
    if (this.currentAnimation === ZombieActions.Attack && this.frameIndex === sprite.frameCount - 1) {
      this.currentAnimation = ZombieActions.Walk;
      this.frameIndex = 0; // Reset frame index for walk animation
    }

    // If the current animation is walk, continue moving the zombie
    if (this.currentAnimation === ZombieActions.Walk) {
      this.position.x += this.velocity.x;
    }

    this.lastFrameTime = timestamp;
  }
}
```

By resetting `this.frameIndex` to `0`, you ensure that the walking animation starts cleanly without any leftover frames that might have been displayed from the attack animation, which could cause a visual glitch. If the glitch persists, you may need to inspect the sprite's `draw` method or the sprite image assets for any inconsistencies that might be causing the issue.
