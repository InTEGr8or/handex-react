summary: The user was facing an issue with the `require` statement not being defined in a TypeScript file in a project configured with ES modules. The assistant explained that using `require` in ES modules is not valid and provided options to address the issue, such as switching to `import` syntax or utilizing Vite's built-in environment variable handling.

The user clarified that the values they wanted to store in `.env` were service endpoints and not sensitive information. They sought a way to store these values in a centralized list for multiple code modules. The assistant recommended using Vite's native support for environment variables by defining them in `.env` files prefixed with `VITE_` and accessing them using `import.meta.env` in TypeScript code.

The assistant detailed the steps to manage environment variables in a Vite project, highlighting the advantages of this approach, including seamless integration, centralized configuration, and enhanced security measures. It also provided additional information on using environment-specific variables and the need to restart the Vite dev server when modifying environment variables.

Overall, the chat discussion revolved around resolving the `require` error, transitioning to using environment variables in a Vite project, and ensuring efficient management of service endpoints across the application.

I am getting an error on this code:

```tsx

require('dotenv').config();
```

```
ReferenceError: require is not defined
  at HandTerm.tsx:21:1
```

The error you're encountering with `require` not being defined in `HandTerm.tsx` is due to your project being configured as an ES module, as indicated by the `"type": "module"` line in your `package.json`. ES module syntax requires using `import` statements instead of `require` for including external modules.

To fix this issue in a file that is part of a project configured to use ES modules, you should switch from `require` to `import` syntax. Since you're working with TypeScript in a React project configured with Vite, you can use dynamic import for loading `.env` configurations or rely on Vite's built-in environment variable handling which automatically exposes environment variables starting with `VITE_` to your project.

For most use cases in a Vite project, you don't need to manually import the `dotenv` package in your frontend code. Vite provides support for environment variables out of the box. You can access environment variables in your project by prefixing them with `VITE_` in your `.env` files, and then access them using `import.meta.env`.

However, if you still need to use the `dotenv` package for some reason (typically more relevant for Node.js backend code rather than Vite-managed React frontend code), here's how you could adjust your code:

1. **Using Vite's Environment Variables (Recommended for Frontend Code):**

First, rename your environment variables in `.env` to start with `VITE_`, like `VITE_API_KEY=your_api_key`.

Then, access this variable in your code using `import.meta.env.VITE_API_KEY`.

2. **Dynamic Import (If you must use `dotenv` in a Frontend Scenario):**

You could dynamically import `dotenv` if you have a specific setup that requires it, but this is highly unusual for client-side code in a Vite project and generally not recommended or necessary.

```tsx
// This is generally NOT necessary for Vite projects and shown for educational purposes
import('dotenv').then((dotenv) => {
  dotenv.config();
});
```

For server-side code or scripts run outside the context of Vite, using `dotenv` with `import` directly is appropriate:

```tsx
// Example for a Node.js script or server-side use
import dotenv from 'dotenv';
dotenv.config();
```

Remember, directly manipulating environment variables on the client side can expose sensitive data. Always ensure that only necessary environment variables are exposed to the client-side code.

The values I'm retrieving from `.env` are just service endpoints, so they are not secret.

I just want a way to store them in one easily editable list, and to read them from several disconnected code modules.

How can I do that?

Given your requirements, the most straightforward approach in a Vite project is to use Vite's built-in support for environment variables. This feature is designed precisely for the scenario you're describing: storing values in an easily editable list (`.env` files) and accessing them across your application without needing to import `dotenv` or use `require`.

### Steps to Use Environment Variables in Vite:

1. **Define Your Environment Variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root of your project if you haven't already. Define your environment variables there, prefixing their names with `VITE_` to make them accessible in your Vite project. For example:

   ```
   VITE_API_URL=https://example.com/api
   ```

2. **Accessing Environment Variables:**
   Access these variables in your TypeScript code using `import.meta.env`. For example:

   ```tsx
   const apiUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL;
   ```

This method meets your criteria for an easily editable list of non-secret service endpoints, accessible across various modules in your application.

### Advantages of This Approach:

- **No Additional Imports Required:** Since Vite injects `import.meta.env` during the build process, you don't need to import or configure `dotenv` in your client-side code.
- **Centralized Configuration:** All your environment variables are defined in one or more `.env` files (e.g., `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.production`) at the root of your project, making them easy to manage.
- **Security:** By following the convention of prefixing environment variable names with `VITE_`, Vite ensures only variables explicitly intended for exposure to the client-side get bundled. Other environment variables not prefixed as such remain inaccessible, preventing accidental exposure of sensitive data.

### Notes:

- **Different Environments:** You can define environment-specific variables using files like `.env.production` for production builds and `.env.development` for local development. Vite automatically picks up the appropriate `.env` file based on the mode in which it's running.
- **Restart Required:** When you add or change environment variables, you need to restart the Vite dev server for the changes to take effect.

By following these practices, you can manage and access your service endpoints across your application efficiently and securely.
