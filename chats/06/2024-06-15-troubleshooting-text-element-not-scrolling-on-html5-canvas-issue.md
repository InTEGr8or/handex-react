I have this code in my `TerminalGame`:

```tsx
 drawScrollingText(context: CanvasRenderingContext2D) {
  // FIXME: This doesn't work anymore.
  console.log("drawScrollingText", this.textToScroll);
  context.font = 'italic 60px Arial'; // Customize as needed
  context.fillStyle = 'lightgreen'; // Text color
  context.fillText(this.textToScroll, this.textScrollX, 85); // Adjust Y coordinate as needed

  // Update the X position for the next frame
  this.textScrollX -= 5; // Adjust speed as needed

  // Reset text position if it's fully offscreen to the left
  if (this.textScrollX < -context.measureText(this.textToScroll).width) {
   this.textScrollX = this.props.canvasWidth;
  }
 }
```

I can see that it runs because the `console.log()` prints to the browser console.

I don't see the letters scroll across the canvas, though.

I need your TypeScript, React, HTML 5 Canvas expertise to help me troubleshoot this.

To troubleshoot why the scrolling text is not visible on the canvas, consider the following steps:

1. **Ensure the Canvas Context is Correct**: Verify that the `context` passed to `drawScrollingText` is the correct `CanvasRenderingContext2D` for the canvas you are trying to draw on.
2. **Check the Canvas Size**: Ensure the canvas size is properly set, and it's large enough to display the text. If the canvas is not visible or too small, the text may not appear.
3. **Correct Starting Position**: The initial value of `this.textScrollX` should be greater than the canvas width to start the text offscreen on the right. Check that this value is being initialized correctly.
4. **Animation Loop**: Make sure that `drawScrollingText` is being called in an animation loop, such as with `requestAnimationFrame`, to continuously update the text's position.
5. **Clear the Canvas**: Before drawing the text, clear the previous frame with `context.clearRect(0, 0, canvasWidth, canvasHeight)` to avoid smearing as the text moves.
6. **Inspect Text Properties**: Verify that the text color contrasts with the background and that the font size and style are correctly set to make the text visible.
7. **Z-Index Issues**: If the canvas is layered with other elements, ensure that the z-index CSS property is set so the canvas is not covered by another element.
8. **Browser DevTools**: Use your browser's developer tools to inspect the canvas element and check for any errors or warnings that might indicate an issue.

If you have already checked these and the issue persists, could you provide more details about how `drawScrollingText` is being invoked within the animation loop? Also, are there any transformations or globalAlpha settings being applied to the context that might affect the visibility of the text?

I can see the `<canvas>` because I can see two animated characters being animated on it.

Your suggestion number 8, how do I do that? How do I use the browser dev tools to inspect the canvas?

To inspect the canvas using browser developer tools, you can follow these steps:

1. **Open DevTools**: Right-click anywhere on your webpage and select "Inspect" or "Inspect Element", depending on your browser. Alternatively, you can press `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Cmd+Option+I on Mac).

2. **Select the Canvas Element**: In the "Elements" panel, navigate through the DOM tree to find the `<canvas>` element. Click on it to inspect its properties.

3. **Check Styles and Attributes**: With the canvas element selected, the "Styles" pane on the right side will show you the CSS styles applied to it. Look for any styles that might affect its visibility (like `display`, `visibility`, or `opacity`). Also, check the `width` and `height` attributes to ensure they are set correctly.

4. **Inspect Canvas Drawings**: To see what is currently rendered on the canvas, you can take a screenshot of the canvas content:
   - Right-click on the `<canvas>` element in the elements panel.
   - Choose "Capture node screenshot". This will download an image of the canvas as it is currently rendered.

5. **Console**: You can interact with the canvas element directly from the console tab. If you have the canvas selected in the elements tab, you can reference it in the console with `$0`. For example, to get the context, you can type:
   ```javascript
   var ctx = $0.getContext('2d');
   ```
   Then you can call drawing methods or inspect the context state directly in the console.

6. **Performance Monitoring**: If you suspect a performance issue with the canvas drawing, you can record a performance profile:
   - Go to the "Performance" tab.
   - Click the record button (circle) at the top-left of the panel.
   - Perform the actions on your page that involve canvas drawing.
   - Click the stop button to end the recording and inspect the results for any bottlenecks.

7. **Breakpoints**: You can use breakpoints to pause the code execution at specific points. If you have access to the source in the "Sources" tab, you can click on the line number where `drawScrollingText` is called to set a breakpoint. When the code execution reaches this point, it will pause, allowing you to inspect variables and step through the code.

Using these tools should help you better understand what's happening with the canvas and why the text might not be visible despite the function being called.

Well, as I said, I can already see two characters being animated on the canvas, so can we please eliminate suggestion on how to check the `<canvas>` visibility or anything related to checking if it's visible.

I can see two characters being animated on the canvas, which means I can see the canvas.

How can I use the dev tools to inspect why one animation is not being rendered on the already visible canvas even while other animations are visible on the visible canvas?

In that case, you can use the following techniques with the browser developer tools to debug the specific issue of one animation not rendering:

1. **Console Logging**: Since you mentioned the `console.log("drawScrollingText", this.textToScroll);` statement is printing, add more `console.log()` statements to log the values of `this.textScrollX` and `context.measureText(this.textToScroll).width`. Ensure the text position is within the visible area of the canvas.

    ```tsx
    console.log("textScrollX", this.textScrollX);
    console.log("text width", context.measureText(this.textToScroll).width);
    ```

2. **Drawing Debug Shapes**: Temporarily draw a simple shape, like a rectangle, at the same position where the text should appear to confirm that drawing operations are working at that location.

    ```tsx
    context.fillStyle = 'red'; // Use a high-contrast color
    context.fillRect(this.textScrollX, 85, 100, 50); // Draw a rectangle where the text should be
    ```

3. **Breakpoints**: Use breakpoints to pause the animation when the scrolling text should be on screen.
    - In the "Sources" tab, find the script containing your animation loop and set a breakpoint on the line inside `drawScrollingText`.
    - When the breakpoint hits, inspect the values of `this.textScrollX` and compare it to the canvas width to make sure the text is being drawn within the visible canvas area.

4. **Inspecting State**: While paused at a breakpoint, hover over variables like `this.textToScroll` and `this.textScrollX` to inspect their values. You can also use the console to modify these values and see the effects immediately on the canvas.

5. **Step through Code**: Step through the code line by line to see exactly when and how your text is being drawn. Check the `fillText` call and ensure the coordinates are what you expect.

6. **Check for Errors**: Make sure there are no errors in the console that could indicate an issue with drawing the text, such as an invalid font value or an out-of-bounds coordinate.

7. **Performance Profiling**: Record a performance profile while the text should be scrolling. Look for any long frames or dropped frames that might indicate why the text isn't appearing.

By narrowing down the issue with these debugging techniques, you should be able to identify why the text isn't appearing as expected on the canvas.
