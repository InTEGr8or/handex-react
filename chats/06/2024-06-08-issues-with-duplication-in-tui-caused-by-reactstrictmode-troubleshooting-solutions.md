original file name: Codeium Chat - p5WOtryEF1dh46XPRtqFd5H8qwsgfhuY.md
summary: The chat begins with a user reporting duplication issues in characters and text elements in a TUI after adding `React.StrictMode`. The assistant explains that StrictMode invokes certain functions twice in development mode and provides guidance on resolving unintended side effects caused by the duplication.

The user then seeks advice on identifying the root of the duplication issue and receives suggestions on searching for potential causes, such as direct DOM manipulations, event handlers, terminal writing operations, state updates, and more.

Subsequently, the user shares event listener code for touch events, and the assistant advises on ensuring proper event listener management to prevent duplication due to StrictMode double-invocation.

Further, the user discusses removing unnecessary DOM operations and revisits the discussion on constructor initialization. They share the code structure of components (`App`, `HandexTerm`, `XtermAdapter`) and inquire about potential side effects in `XtermAdapter` constructor.

The assistant reviews the `XtermAdapter` constructor code and confirms that it appears free from side effects, providing a breakdown of each operation for clarification.

This code is causing duplication of characters and text elements in my TUI.

I started happening when I added `React.StrictMode`

`React.StrictMode` is a tool for highlighting potential problems in your React application. It intentionally double-invokes the following functions:

- Constructor
- `render` method
- `shouldComponentUpdate`
- Methods of the lifecycle (previously known as "lifecycle hooks")
- `setState` updater functions (the first argument)

These double-invocations only occur in development mode. They help you find and fix unintended side effects in the render phase, which can be problematic for the upcoming asynchronous rendering mode in React.

If you're seeing duplication of characters or text elements, it might be because your code has side effects in one of the above-mentioned methods or functions. For example, if you're manipulating the DOM directly or altering the state directly in any of these methods without using `setState`, `StrictMode` might cause unexpected behavior by calling these methods twice.

To fix the issue, ensure that:

- Any side effects (e.g., data fetching, subscriptions, or manual DOM manipulations) are done in `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, or the `useEffect` hook.
- You do not directly manipulate the DOM. Instead, let React handle the DOM updates.
- State updates should only be done using `setState` and not by directly mutating the state.
- Ensure no code relies on a function being called a single time only (e.g., initializers or one-time event bindings).

Removing `React.StrictMode` will likely "fix" the duplication, but it's better to address the root cause. Can you provide the specific code where the characters and text elements are being rendered or manipulated so I can help you address the issue more directly?

The duplication is happening with every character that I type into the `xterm` and also the prompt that  write to the `xterm`.

I agree that it would be better to find the root of the problem. 

Can you provide any specific string patterns that I can search for or any other way that I can find what's causing the duplication?

**Codeium** _at 9:28 am, Jun 8, 2024_

Given that the duplication happens with every character typed into `xterm` as well as the prompt, the issue is likely to be in the parts of your code that handle keyboard input and writing to the `xterm` terminal.

Here are some string patterns and potential causes you can search for and investigate to find what's causing the duplication:

1. **Direct DOM Manipulations**: Search for any direct DOM manipulations in your class methods. Look for patterns like `document.getElementById`, `document.querySelector`, or any direct assignments to `innerHTML`, `innerText`, or similar properties.

2. **Event Handlers**: Since the issue occurs with typing, check for event handlers related to keyboard input. Patterns like `onKey`, `onKeyPress`, `onKeyDown`, `onKeyUp` might be relevant.

3. **Terminal Writing Operations**: Look for where you're writing to the terminal using `xterm`'s API. Search for patterns such as `terminal.write`, which is the method used to output text to the terminal.

4. **State Updates**: Examine where you're updating the state, especially in relation to input handling. Look for `setState` calls that might be triggered on each keypress.

5. **Initialization in Constructor**: Since `StrictMode` double-invokes the constructor in development, ensure you're not initializing anything that should only happen once within the constructor. Look for patterns like `new Terminal` or any initialization that might duplicate bindings or listeners.

6. **Component Lifecycle Methods**: Search for the use of lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount` and `componentDidUpdate`. Ensure you're not setting up event listeners without proper cleanup in `componentWillUnmount` (which `StrictMode` might also double-invoke).

7. **useEffect Hooks**: If you're using functional components with hooks, search for `useEffect`. Make sure that any side effects within these hooks properly clean up after themselves to avoid duplicates on re-invocation.

8. **Ref Callbacks**: In `StrictMode`, ref callbacks are invoked twice. Search for `ref` usage and ensure that any logic within ref callbacks is idempotent and doesn't lead to duplication.

9. **Custom Methods in Class**: Examine any custom methods that might be associated with the typing or prompt functionality. Look for method names relevant to the feature you're troubleshooting.

10. **External Calls**: If your component interacts with external libraries or services, check how these interactions are handled. Make sure that external calls are not being made multiple times unnecessarily.

You can start by putting `console.log` statements in the constructor, event handlers, and any method that writes to the terminal to see if they're being called more times than expected. Once you identify such a method, you can investigate further to ensure it's following best practices for idempotent operations and proper setup/cleanup.

I have these event listeners but this is because it is the only way to `preventDefault` in React, from what I understand:

```tsx
 addTouchListeners() {
  // Assuming 'terminalElementRef' points to the div you want to attach the event
  const div = this.terminalElementRef.current;
  if (div) {
   div.addEventListener('touchmove', this.handleTouchMove, { passive: false });
  }
  const output = window.document.getElementById(TerminalCssClasses.Output);
  if (output) {
   output.addEventListener('touchmove', this.handleTouchMove, { passive: false });
  }
  const terminal = document.getElementById(TerminalCssClasses.Terminal);
  if (terminal) {
   terminal.addEventListener('touchmove', this.handleTouchMove, { passive: false });
  }
 }

 removeTouchListeners() {
  const div = this.terminalElementRef.current;
  if (div) {
   div.removeEventListener('touchmove', this.handleTouchMove);
  }
  const output = window.document.getElementById(TerminalCssClasses.Output);
  if (output) {
   output.removeEventListener('touchmove', this.handleTouchMove);
  }
  const terminal = document.getElementById(TerminalCssClasses.Terminal);
  if (terminal) {
   terminal.removeEventListener('touchmove', this.handleTouchMove);
  }
 }
```

The code you've provided for `addTouchListeners` and `removeTouchListeners` looks correct for attaching and detaching event listeners in a way that allows `preventDefault` to be called in React. 

However, if `React.StrictMode` is causing duplication, it might be invoking `componentDidMount` or `componentDidUpdate` twice, which can lead to the event listeners being added twice. This typically shouldn't cause duplication of characters or text elements within `xterm`, but it's important to ensure that the listeners are not causing any unexpected side effects.

In your `componentDidMount`, make sure you are adding the touch listeners only once and removing them properly in `componentWillUnmount` to prevent memory leaks or duplicate event handling:

```tsx
componentDidMount() {
  this.addTouchListeners();
  // ... any other initialization code
}

componentWillUnmount() {
  this.removeTouchListeners();
  // ... any other cleanup code
}
```

Also, ensure that `handleTouchMove` and any other event handlers called by these listeners are idempotent and not causing state updates or actions that would result in text being duplicated.

For debugging, you can add logging to `addTouchListeners` and `removeTouchListeners` to confirm that they are each only called once:

```tsx
addTouchListeners() {
  console.log('Adding touch listeners');
  // ... rest of the code
}

removeTouchListeners() {
  console.log('Removing touch listeners');
  // ... rest of the code
}
```

If you find that these methods are being called more than once, it may be due to `StrictMode`. If that's the case, you may need to adjust your code to ensure that the event listeners are managed correctly, or consider if `StrictMode` is necessary for your use case.

Regarding the duplication of characters in the `xterm` terminal, the issue is likely elsewhere. You'll need to look at the code where you are handling the input from the keyboard and writing to the terminal. Search for any code that might be invoking `terminal.write` or similar methods multiple times for a single input event.

I have removed several DOM operations that I didn't need.

Now I want to return to your recommendation about initializting in the constructor.

The `App` doesn't have a constructor because it's a functional component:

```tsx
// App.tsx
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
import { HandexTerm } from './HandexTerm';
import SpriteManagerContext from './game/SpriteManagerContext';
import { SpriteManager } from './game/sprites/SpriteManager';
// App.tsx

const spriteManager = new SpriteManager();

const App = () => {
 const containerRef = React.createRef<HTMLDivElement>();
 const [containerWidth, setContainerWidth] = React.useState<number>(0);

 useEffect(() => {
  const w = getContainerWidth();
  console.log(`containerWidth: ${w}`);
  setContainerWidth(w);
 }, [])

 const getContainerWidth = () => {
  return containerRef.current?.clientWidth ?? 0
 }

 useEffect(() => {
  const handleResize = () => {
   const w = getContainerWidth();
   console.log(`containerWidth: ${w}`);
   setContainerWidth(w);
  };

  window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
  return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
 })

 return (
  <SpriteManagerContext.Provider value={spriteManager}>
   <div ref={containerRef}>
    <HandexTerm
     terminalWidth={containerWidth}
    />
   </div>
  </SpriteManagerContext.Provider>
 );
};

export default App;
```

But it loads the `HandexTerm` which does have a constructor:

```tsx
 constructor(IHandexTermProps: IHandexTermProps) {
  super(IHandexTermProps);
  this._persistence = new LocalStoragePersistence();
  this.state = {
   outputElements: this.getCommandHistory(),
   isInPhraseMode: false,
   phrase: '', // Initial value
   isActive: false,
   commandLine: '',
   heroAction: 'Idle',
   zombie4Action: 'Walk',
   terminalSize: undefined,
   terminalFontSize: 17
  }
  this.loadDebugValue();
  this.loadFontSize();
 }

 componentDidMount(): void {
  if (this.adapterRef.current) {
   const size = this.adapterRef.current.getTerminalSize();
   if (size) {
    this.setState({ terminalSize: size });
   }
  }
  window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight);

  this.addTouchListeners();
 }
```

And that loads the `XtermAdapter` which looks like it does initialize the `Terminal` in the constructor:

```tsx
 constructor(props: IXtermAdapterProps) {
  super(props);
  const { terminalElementRef } = props;
  this.terminalElementRef = terminalElementRef;
  this.state = {
  }
  // this.videoElement = this.createVideoElement();
  // this.terminalElement.prepend(this.videoElement);
  this.terminal = new Terminal({
   fontFamily: '"Fira Code", Menlo, "DejaVu Sans Mono", "Lucida Console", monospace',
   cursorBlink: true,
   cursorStyle: 'block',
   cursorInactiveStyle: 'outline',
   fontSize: this.props.terminalFontSize
  });
 }

 initializeTerminal() {
  const { terminalElementRef } = this.props;
  if (terminalElementRef?.current) {
   this.terminalElementRef = terminalElementRef;
   this.terminal.open(terminalElementRef.current);
   this.terminal.loadAddon(this.fitAddon);
   this.fitAddon.fit();
   this.terminal.write('\x1b[4h');
   // Other terminal initialization code...
  }
 }
```

Initializing the `Terminal` instance in the `XtermAdapter` constructor is the correct approach if you want to ensure that the `Terminal` object is tied to the lifecycle of `XtermAdapter` instances. However, make sure that the initialization code doesn't have side effects that depend on the DOM or other aspects of the environment that might not be ready during the initial construction phase.

The `initializeTerminal` method, which you call in `componentDidMount`, is fine because `componentDidMount` is called after the component is mounted and has a DOM representation. This is the right place for any additional setup that requires a DOM node, like calling `this.terminal.open`.

Since you mentioned that `React.StrictMode` causes some methods to be called more than once, it's crucial to ensure that any side effects in the constructor of `XtermAdapter` are safe to run multiple times or are idempotent. However, the actual creation of the `Terminal` instance should not cause duplication of characters as long as the terminal is not attached to the DOM multiple times, and event listeners are managed correctly.

Here are some points to check in your `XtermAdapter`:

1. **Initialization**: Ensure that the `Terminal` is only attached to the DOM once. If `this.terminal.open` is called multiple times with the same DOM node, it could potentially cause issues.

2. **Event Listeners**: Make sure that all event listeners added to the `Terminal` instance are properly cleaned up in `componentWillUnmount` to prevent duplicate event handling.

3. **Idempotent Operations**: Ensure that the operations done in the constructor and `initializeTerminal` are idempotent, meaning they can run more than once without causing unintended effects.

4. **State Management**: Make sure that the state is managed properly and that state updates that depend on props are handled in `componentDidUpdate`, not in the constructor.

5. **Async Operations**: If there are any asynchronous operations or promises involved in the initialization, ensure they are handled correctly and don't lead to race conditions or multiple invocations.

By following these guidelines, you can help prevent issues that might arise from `React.StrictMode`'s double-invocation in development mode. If the problem persists, you may need to provide more specific code or details about how characters are being duplicated for further assistance.

This is the constructor for `XtermAdapter`. Which items do you think might be causing side-effects?

```tsx
 constructor(props: IXtermAdapterProps) {
  super(props);
  const { terminalElementRef } = props;
  this.terminalElementRef = terminalElementRef;
  this.state = {
  }
  this.terminal = new Terminal({
   fontFamily: '"Fira Code", Menlo, "DejaVu Sans Mono", "Lucida Console", monospace',
   cursorBlink: true,
   cursorStyle: 'block',
   cursorInactiveStyle: 'outline',
   fontSize: this.props.terminalFontSize
  });
 }
```

The constructor for `XtermAdapter` appears to be free from side effects. It primarily sets up the `terminal` instance and initializes the state. Here's a breakdown of the operations:

- `super(props);`: Calls the parent class constructor, which is necessary and has no side effects.
- `const { terminalElementRef } = props;`: Destructures `props` to get `terminalElementRef`, which is just a reference assignment and has no side effects.
- `this.terminalElementRef = terminalElementRef;`: Assigns the `terminalElementRef` to the class instance, which is safe and has no side effects.
- `this.state = {};`: Initializes the component state to an empty object, which is a standard pattern in React class components and has no side effects.
- `this.terminal = new Terminal({...});`: Creates a new instance of the `Terminal` class. This operation is side-effect-free as long as the `Terminal` constructor itself is free of side effects.

All these operations are standard for a React component constructor and do not interact with the DOM or perform any asynchronous operations. Therefore, they should be safe even when `React.StrictMode` is enabled, which might cause the constructor to be called more than once.

The `Terminal` instance is only created here and not attached to the DOM until `initializeTerminal` is called, typically in `componentDidMount`. As long as `initializeTerminal` is called once and properly manages any event listeners or other side effects, there should not be any issues due to `React.StrictMode`.

If you're experiencing duplication of characters in `xterm`, consider looking at how and where you handle the input events and write to the terminal instance. Make sure you're not accidentally writing to the terminal more than once for the same input event.

Apparently I am calling `initializeTerminal` in two places:

```tsx
 componentDidMount() {
  const { terminalElementRef } = this.props;
  if (terminalElementRef?.current) {
   this.initializeTerminal();
  } else {
   console.error('terminalElementRef.current is NULL');
  }
  this.terminal.onData(this.onDataHandler.bind(this));
  this.terminal.onCursorMove(() => {
   // console.log('cursor move', this.terminal.buffer);
  })
  // this.loadCommandHistory();
  this.setViewPortOpacity();
  this.terminal.focus();
  this.prompt();
  if (this.videoElementRef.current) {
   this.webCam = new WebCam(this.videoElementRef.current);
  }
  window.addEventListener('resize', this.handleResize);
 }

 componentDidUpdate(prevProps: Readonly<IXtermAdapterProps>): void {
  if (prevProps.terminalElementRef?.current !== this.props.terminalElementRef?.current) {
   this.initializeTerminal();
  }
 }
```

Calling `initializeTerminal` from both `componentDidMount` and `componentDidUpdate` is not inherently problematic, but it can lead to issues if `initializeTerminal` performs non-idempotent operations that should only happen once. 

The `initializeTerminal` method is correctly called in `componentDidMount` to set up the terminal when the component mounts. This is the right place to do initial setup.

However, it's also called in `componentDidUpdate` to re-initialize the terminal if `terminalElementRef` changes. This is appropriate if you expect the `terminalElementRef` to point to a different DOM element at some point. But if that's not the case, then this call is unnecessary and could potentially lead to issues if `initializeTerminal` isn't designed to be called multiple times safely.

Here are the key things to ensure in `initializeTerminal`:

1. **Idempotence**: Make sure that calling `initializeTerminal` multiple times doesn't duplicate event listeners, DOM manipulations, or other side effects.

2. **Cleanup**: If `initializeTerminal` replaces the terminal instance or rebinds event handlers, ensure that any previous instances or bindings are properly cleaned up.

3. **Conditional Execution**: If `initializeTerminal` should only run under specific conditions, make sure those conditions are checked before calling it.

If `initializeTerminal` is not safe to run multiple times, you might run into issues with `StrictMode`. To make it safe, you could refactor it to unbind previous event listeners and clear any previous terminal state before initializing a new one. 

Alternatively, if the terminal does not need to be re-initialized when `terminalElementRef` changes, you could remove the call from `componentDidUpdate` and rely on the one in `componentDidMount`, ensuring it only runs once when the component mounts. If `terminalElementRef` is not expected to change, you might not need to check for it in `componentDidUpdate` at all. 

Finally, ensure that `componentWillUnmount` cleans up any event listeners or other resources to prevent memory leaks and other issues when the component unmounts.

This is the multiple prompt HTML:

```html
<div style="width: 1240px; height: 24px; line-height: 24px; overflow: hidden;"><span class="xterm-bold xterm-fg-12" style="letter-spacing: 0.00758495px;">guest@handex.io </span><span class="xterm-bold xterm-fg-10" style="letter-spacing: 0.00758495px;">~$</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.00758495px;"> </span><span class="xterm-bold xterm-fg-12" style="letter-spacing: 0.00758495px;">guest@handex.io </span><span class="xterm-bold xterm-fg-10" style="letter-spacing: 0.00758495px;">~$</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.00758495px;"> </span><span class="xterm-cursor xterm-cursor-outline" style="letter-spacing: 0.00758495px;"> </span></div>
```

**Codeium** _at 12:49 pm, Jun 8, 2024_

The HTML provided shows that the prompt (`guest@handex.io ~$`) is being rendered twice before the cursor span element. This might happen if the `prompt` method in your `XtermAdapter.tsx` is called more than once without clearing the previous prompt, or if the terminal's internal buffer isn't being managed correctly before displaying a new prompt.

Here are a few things to check in your code to resolve this issue:

1. **Ensure `prompt` is not called multiple times unintentionally**: Check where the `prompt` method is called in your code. It should typically be called once after the terminal is initialized and then again only after a command has been processed and you're ready to display a new prompt.

2. **Clear the terminal before displaying a new prompt**: Before calling `this.terminal.write(promptText)` in the `prompt` method, you might want to clear the terminal or move to a new line to ensure that you're starting fresh. You can clear the terminal with `this.terminal.clear()`.

3. **Check for re-renders**: If your React component is re-rendering for some reason, it might be calling the `prompt` method again. Make sure that state updates or prop changes aren't leading to unintended re-renders that call the prompt method.

4. **Check terminal buffer management**: If you're managing the terminal's buffer manually (for example, appending or removing lines), ensure that you're doing it correctly. Incorrect buffer management could lead to duplicated prompts.

5. **StrictMode double invocation**: If `React.StrictMode` is causing double invocation of lifecycle methods or constructor, ensure that this isn't leading to the `prompt` method being called twice.

You might want to add logging inside the `prompt` method to see how many times it is being called and under what circumstances. This can help you pinpoint if the issue is with multiple invocations or with the way the terminal's buffer is being handled.

Here's an example of how you might modify the `prompt` method to ensure it starts on a new line and only shows one prompt:

```tsx
prompt(user: string = 'guest', host: string = 'handex.io') {
  // Move to a new line before writing the prompt to avoid duplication
  this.terminal.write('\r\n'); // Carriage return and newline
  const promptText = `\x1b[1;34m${user}@${host} \x1b[0m\x1b[1;32m~${this.promptDelimiter}\x1b[0m `;
  this.promptLength = promptText.length - 21; // Adjust for ANSI escape codes
  this.terminal.write(promptTyping ASCII shows up in the terminal when it is in focus.); // Write the prompt
}
```

Make sure to adjust the logic according to how your application is structured and when you expect the prompt to be displayed.

It's not just the `prompt`.

This is the `.xterm-rows first-child` after typing the word `test`

```html
<div style="width: 1240px; height: 24px; line-height: 24px; overflow: hidden;"><span class="xterm-bold xterm-fg-12" style="letter-spacing: 0.00758495px;">guest@handex.io </span><span class="xterm-bold xterm-fg-10" style="letter-spacing: 0.00758495px;">~$</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.00758495px;"> </span><span class="xterm-bold xterm-fg-12" style="letter-spacing: 0.00758495px;">guest@handex.io </span><span class="xterm-bold xterm-fg-10" style="letter-spacing: 0.00758495px;">~$</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.00758495px;"> tteesstt</span><span class="xterm-cursor xterm-cursor-outline" style="letter-spacing: 0.00758495px;"> </span></div>
```

**Codeium** _at 12:53 pm, Jun 8, 2024_

The duplication of both the prompt and the typed characters (`tteesstt`) suggests that each keystroke is being processed twice, leading to each character being written to the terminal twice.

Here's what you should check:

1. **Event Handlers**: Verify that the event handler for keypresses is not being attached multiple times. If `StrictMode` is causing `componentDidMount` to run twice, and you're attaching event handlers there without removing them first, this could cause the handlers to duplicate.

2. **Data Handling in `onDataHandler`**: Since `this.terminal.onData()` is being called with `this.onDataHandler.bind(this)`, check the `onDataHandler` method to ensure it's not writing data to the terminal twice for each event.

3. **Component Re-rendering**: Confirm that your component isn't being re-rendered unnecessarily, which could cause lifecycle methods to run multiple times.

To debug the issue, you can add logging within your event handlers and lifecycle methods to see if they're being called more times than you expect. This can help identify if `StrictMode` or something else is causing unexpected behavior.

For example, add a `console.log` statement in your `onDataHandler` method to log each data event:

```tsx
onDataHandler(data: string): void {
  console.log('Data received:', data);
  // ... existing handling code ...
}
```

Also, check your method for attaching event listeners and ensure you're not adding a new listener without first removing the previous one. Here's an example of how to safeguard against multiple listeners:

```tsx
componentDidMount() {
  // Remove the existing onData event handler before attaching a new one
  this.terminal.off('data', this.onDataHandler);
  // Now attach the onData event handler
  this.terminal.on('data', this.onDataHandler.bind(this));
  // ... other initialization code ...
}

componentWillUnmount() {
  // Make sure to remove the onData event handler when the component unmounts
  this.terminal.off('data', this.onDataHandler);
  // ... other cleanup code ...
}
```

If you find that event handlers are indeed being attached multiple times, you'll need to adjust your code to ensure that each event handler is only attached once. This might involve moving the event listener setup to a different part of your code where you can guarantee it will only run once or managing the event listeners in a way that's safe for potential re-invocations caused by `StrictMode`.

This is how the `onData` is set. Again, there is no `on`. This is client-side TypeScript.

```tsx 
componentDidMount() {
  const { terminalElementRef } = this.props;
  if (terminalElementRef?.current) {
   this.initializeTerminal();
  } else {
   console.error('terminalElementRef.current is NULL');
  }
  this.terminal.onData(this.onDataHandler.bind(this));
  this.terminal.onCursorMove(() => {
   // console.log('cursor move', this.terminal.buffer);

Apologies for the confusion. In the context of the `@xterm/xterm` library, you are correct that the way to listen to events is using the `.onData()` and similar methods provided by the `Terminal` instance.

From the `componentDidMount` snippet, it looks like `this.onDataHandler` is bound to the `data` event of `this.terminal`. The `.bind(this)` creates a new function with the correct `this` context for `onDataHandler`. If `componentDidMount` is called multiple times due to `React.StrictMode`, multiple handlers could be bound. However, they would not be the same function, and thus you cannot easily remove them without a reference.

To avoid potential issues with `React.StrictMode` and double-binding, you could bind `this.onDataHandler` in the constructor and use that bound function to set up and tear down the event listener:

```tsx
constructor(props: IXtermAdapterProps) {
  super(props);
  // ...other constructor code...
  this.onDataHandler = this.onDataHandler.bind(this);
}

componentDidMount() {
  // ...other componentDidMount code...
  this.terminal.onData(this.onDataHandler);
  // ...rest of componentDidMount code...
}

componentWillUnmount() {
  // Make sure to remove the onData event handler when the component unmounts
  this.terminal.offData(this.onDataHandler);
  // ...rest of componentWillUnmount code...
}
```

With this change, the same reference to the bound function is used to add and remove the event listener, ensuring that you do not attach the handler multiple times.

Now, if characters are still being duplicated, you would want to inspect the implementation of `this.onDataHandler`:

```tsx
onDataHandler(data: string): void {
  // Your data handling logic
  // Log to see if it is called more than once per input
  console.log('Handling data:', data);
  // ...rest of the onDataHandler code...
}
```

Use the console log to check if `onDataHandler` is being invoked more than once per input. If it is, you might be encountering a side effect or bug in your implementation.

Lastly, ensure your `XtermAdapter` component is not being mounted more than once. If it is, you will have more than one instance of `XtermAdapter` each with its own terminal instance, which could lead to duplicated input handling. You can check for multiple mounts by adding a log statement in the `constructor` or `componentDidMount` and checking if it appears more than once in the console when you expect it to run only once.

Should I create some kind of `terminal.offData()`. There doesn't seem to be one in `xterm`

Apologies for the oversight. You're correct that `@xterm/xterm` does not have an `offData` method. Instead, the `onData` method returns a disposable object that you can call to remove the event listener.

To correctly clean up the event listener, you should capture the disposable object when you attach the event listener and call it when the component unmounts:

```tsx
private onDataDisposable: IDisposable | null = null;

componentDidMount() {
  // ...other componentDidMount code...
  this.onDataDisposable = this.terminal.onData(this.onDataHandler);
  // ...rest of componentDidMount code...
}

componentWillUnmount() {
  // Use the disposable to remove the onData event handler
  if (this.onDataDisposable) {
    this.onDataDisposable.dispose();
  }
  // ...rest of componentWillUnmount code...
}
```

This approach ensures that you are correctly attaching and detaching the event listener according to the lifecycle of the `XtermAdapter` component.

Make sure to apply the same pattern to any other event listeners that return disposables, such as `onCursorMove` if needed.

Now, if you observe that the onData event handler is called multiple times for a single data event, you might want to check if the `XtermAdapter` component is being mounted more than once or if there are any other places in your application where you are unintentionally writing to the terminal.

Ok, that is implemented. I still see two terminal outputs.

Any other ideas?

Anything else you can see in `XtermAdapter`?

I now have `<React.StrictMode>` wrapping `XtermAdapter` only, and I still see the problem.

Given the updates and your implementation of the disposable pattern, if you're still experiencing issues with duplicated terminal outputs, here are a few additional steps to consider:

1. **Check for Multiple Instances**: Ensure that only one instance of `XtermAdapter` is being mounted. Multiple instances could result in duplicated outputs if they are both writing to the same DOM element.

2. **Inspect `prompt` and Write Operations**: Review how the `prompt` method is invoked and ensure that it, along with any other write operations to the terminal (`this.terminal.write()`), are only called once per action.

3. **Logging**: Add logging inside the `prompt` method, `onDataHandler`, and any methods that write to the terminal to trace how many times they're called and the sequence of operations.

4. **Review Related Components**: If `XtermAdapter` is wrapped in `React.StrictMode` and you're still seeing the problem, inspect parent and child components for any operations that might be causing re-renders or additional writes to the terminal.

5. **Examine External Interactions**: If your terminal interacts with external services or APIs, ensure that these interactions are not resulting in duplicated commands or outputs.

6. **Debugging**: Use the browser's debugging tools to set breakpoints in your event handlers and rendering logic to step through the code and inspect the call stack. This can help identify where the extra output is originating from.

7. **State and Props Changes**: Make sure that changes in state or props that affect the terminal are handled correctly. Unintended state changes could cause additional re-renders or side effects.

8. **Terminal Configuration**: Review the configuration of the `Terminal` instance to ensure there are no properties set that could cause duplication, and check the documentation for any known issues or relevant configuration options.

9. **React.StrictMode Effects**: If you still suspect `React.StrictMode`, try temporarily removing it and seeing if the issue persists. If the issue goes away, it might be related to a side effect being triggered by the double invocation pattern in development mode.

10. **Dependencies**: Check if there are any updates to `@xterm/xterm` or related dependencies that might address the issue, or if there are any open issues in their repositories that describe a similar problem.

If after trying the above steps you are still facing the issue, please provide more details or a larger portion of your `XtermAdapter` implementation to further investigate the problem.
