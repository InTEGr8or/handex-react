In my `TerminalGame` I am loading some background images like this:

```tsx
 componentDidMount() {
  console.log("Hero x: ", this.state.heroPosition, " Canvas width: ", this.props.canvasWidth);
  this.foregroundBuildings.src = '/images/parallax-industrial-pack/parallax-industrial-pack/layers/skill-desc_0000_foreground.png' + '?t=' + new Date().getTime();
  this.backgroundBuildings.src = '/images/parallax-industrial-pack/parallax-industrial-pack/layers/skill-desc_0001_buildings.png' + '?t=' + new Date().getTime();
  this.farBuildings.src = '/images/parallax-industrial-pack/parallax-industrial-pack/layers/skill-desc_0002_far-buildings.png' + '?t=' + new Date().getTime();
  const canvas = this.canvasRef.current;
  if (canvas) {
   const context = canvas.getContext('2d');
   if (context) {
    this.hero = new Hero(
     context, this.state.heroAction, this.state.heroPosition
    );
    this.zombie4 = new Zombie4(
     context, this.state.zombieAction, this.state.zombie4Position
    );
    this.setupCanvas();
   }
  }
 }
```

but I have some additional assets that I would like to arrange into game "levels", so that I show one background with several parallax images for one level, and then a different background of several parallax images for a different level.

How can I structure that in my React app while using React best practices and modern development techniques?

To structure your game levels with different sets of parallax backgrounds in a React app, you can follow these best practices:

1. **Componentization**: Break down your game into smaller components for better maintainability and reusability.

2. **State Management**: Use state to track the current level and conditionally render the appropriate backgrounds.

3. **Props**: Pass necessary data to components through props to control what is rendered.

Here’s a conceptual structure for your app:

```tsx
// LevelBackground.tsx
import React from 'react';

interface LevelBackgroundProps {
  foregroundSrc: string;
  backgroundSrc: string;
  farBackgroundSrc: string;
}

export const LevelBackground: React.FC<LevelBackgroundProps> = ({ foregroundSrc, backgroundSrc, farBackgroundSrc }) => (
  <>
    <img className="far-buildings" src={farBackgroundSrc} alt="Far Buildings" />
    <img className="background-buildings" src={backgroundSrc} alt="Background Buildings" />
    <img className="foreground" src={foregroundSrc} alt="Foreground" />
  </>
);
```

```tsx
// Level.tsx
import React from 'react';
import { LevelBackground } from './LevelBackground';

interface LevelProps {
  level: number;
  // Other props like character positions, actions, etc.
}

export const Level: React.FC<LevelProps> = ({ level }) => {
  const getBackgroundImages = (level: number) => {
    // Logic to select images based on current level
    // This can be an array of objects, switch statement or any other logic
  };

  const { foregroundSrc, backgroundSrc, farBackgroundSrc } = getBackgroundImages(level);

  return (
    <>
      <LevelBackground foregroundSrc={foregroundSrc} backgroundSrc={backgroundSrc} farBackgroundSrc={farBackgroundSrc} />
      {/* Render your characters and other level elements here */}
    </>
  );
};
```

```tsx
// TerminalGame.tsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Level } from './Level';

interface TerminalGameState {
  currentLevel: number;
  // Other state properties
}

export class TerminalGame extends Component<{}, TerminalGameState> {
  state: TerminalGameState = {
    currentLevel: 1,
    // Other initial state
  };

  // Logic to change levels
  changeLevel = (newLevel: number) => {
    this.setState({ currentLevel: newLevel });
  };

  render() {
    const { currentLevel } = this.state;

    return (
      <Level level={currentLevel} />
      // Add controls and other game elements
    );
  }
}
```

**Best Practices:**

- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has a single responsibility (e.g., `LevelBackground` only handles the background images).

- **DRY Principle**: Avoid repeating code. If the background setup logic is the same across levels, create a single component that can be reused.

- **State Lifting**: If multiple components need access to the current level, consider lifting the state to their closest common ancestor or use a state management library like Redux or Context API.

- **Immutability**: When updating state, make sure to use immutable update patterns.

- **Performance Optimization**: Use techniques like lazy loading for assets and memoization for components if performance becomes an issue.

This structure allows you to easily add or modify levels and their corresponding assets while keeping your code organized and maintainable.

When I put this in `Level.tsx`:

```tsx
 const { foregroundSrc, backgroundSrc, farBackgroundSrc } = getBackgroundImages(level);
```

I get an error. It doesn't recognise `foregroundSrc`, etc.

The error you're encountering with `foregroundSrc`, `backgroundSrc`, and `farBackgroundSrc` is likely due to one of the following reasons:

- The function `getBackgroundImages` is not returning an object with these properties.
- The function `getBackgroundImages` is not fully implemented.

Based on the context provided from `{Level.tsx:Level.getBackgroundImages}`, it seems that the actual logic to select and return images based on the current level is missing. You need to implement this function to return an object with the properties `foregroundSrc`, `backgroundSrc`, and `farBackgroundSrc`.

Here's an example implementation:

```tsx
// Level.tsx
const getBackgroundImages = (level: number) => {
  // Example logic to select images based on the current level
  const levelBackgrounds = {
    1: {
      foregroundSrc: 'path/to/level1/foreground.png',
      backgroundSrc: 'path/to/level1/background.png',
      farBackgroundSrc: 'path/to/level1/far-background.png',
    },
    2: {
      foregroundSrc: 'path/to/level2/foreground.png',
      backgroundSrc: 'path/to/level2/background.png',
      farBackgroundSrc: 'path/to/level2/far-background.png',
    },
    // Add more levels as needed
  };

  // Default to the first level if the specified level doesn't exist
  return levelBackgrounds[level] || levelBackgrounds[1];
};

// ... rest of the Level component
```

Make sure you replace `'path/to/level1/foreground.png'`, `'path/to/level1/background.png'`, and `'path/to/level1/far-background.png'` with the actual paths to your image assets.

With this implementation, calling `getBackgroundImages(level)` will return the appropriate image paths for the given level, and you should be able to destructure them without errors.

I like where we are going with this, but I am getting this error:

```
Element implicitly has an 'any' type because expression of type 'number' can't be used to index type '{ 1: { foregroundSrc: string; backgroundSrc: string; farBackgroundSrc: string; }; 2: { foregroundSrc: string; backgroundSrc: string; farBackgroundSrc: string; }; }'.
 No index signature with a parameter of type 'number' was found on type '{ 1: { foregroundSrc: string; backgroundSrc: string; farBackgroundSrc: string; }; 2: { foregroundSrc: string; backgroundSrc: string; farBackgroundSrc: string; }; }'.
```

The TypeScript error you're encountering suggests that the object `levelBackgrounds` is not properly indexed by numbers, according to TypeScript's type system. TypeScript is strict about object keys and expects them to be strings or string-like values when indexing objects.

To resolve this error, you can use a type assertion to tell TypeScript that indexing by a number is expected for the `levelBackgrounds` object. Alternatively, you could use a `Map<number, { foregroundSrc: string; backgroundSrc: string; farBackgroundSrc: string;}>` which naturally supports number keys.

Here's how you would modify your `getBackgroundImages` function using a type assertion:

```tsx
const getBackgroundImages = (level: number) => {
  const levelBackgrounds: { [key: number]: { foregroundSrc: string; backgroundSrc: string; farBackgroundSrc: string; } } = {
    1: {
      foregroundSrc: 'path/to/level1/foreground.png',
      backgroundSrc: 'path/to/level1/background.png',
      farBackgroundSrc: 'path/to/level1/far-background.png',
    },
    2: {
      foregroundSrc: 'path/to/level2/foreground.png',
      backgroundSrc: 'path/to/level2/background.png',
      farBackgroundSrc: 'path/to/level2/far-background.png',
    },
    // Add more levels as needed
  };

  return levelBackgrounds[level] || levelBackgrounds[1];
};
```

In the above code, `{ [key: number]: { foregroundSrc: string; backgroundSrc: string; farBackgroundSrc: string; } }` is an index signature stating that the object `levelBackgrounds` can be indexed by a number, and the value at that index is an object with `foregroundSrc`, `backgroundSrc`, and `farBackgroundSrc` properties.

This should resolve the TypeScript error and allow you to retrieve the background images using a numeric level key.

OK, that part is working, however, there was some parallax and scaling code that we did not integrate:

```tsx
 updateCharacterAndBackground() {
  const canvasCenterX = this.props.canvasWidth * this.heroXPercent;
  const characterReachThreshold = canvasCenterX; // Character stays in the middle

  if (!this.hero) return;
  // Get the current horizontal movement from the hero's currentAction state
  const heroDx = this.hero.getCurrentAction().dx / 4; // Assuming this.state.heroAction.dx exists

  // Update character position as usual
  const newHeroPositionX = canvasCenterX;

  // Check if the hero reaches the threshold

  if (newHeroPositionX >= characterReachThreshold) {
   this.isInScrollMode = true;
   // Stop the hero's horizontal movement at the threshold
   this.setState({ heroPosition: { ...this.state.heroPosition, leftX: characterReachThreshold } });

   // Update the background position
   this.updateBackgroundPosition(this.state.backgroundOffsetX + heroDx);
   if (this.zombie4) this.zombie4.position.leftX -= heroDx;
  } else {
   // Update the hero's position normally
   this.setState({ heroPosition: { ...this.state.heroPosition, leftX: newHeroPositionX } });
  }

  // Update zombie positions relative to the backgroundOffsetX
  // Assuming you have a method to update zombies
  // this.updateZombiesPosition();
 }

 drawBackground(context: CanvasRenderingContext2D) {

  context.globalAlpha = 1; // Set to desired transparency level (0 to 1)

  this.drawParallaxLayer(
   context,
   this.farBuildings, // the image for the background layer
   0.8, // scale for the background buildings
   0.4 // rate of movement relative to the foreground
  );
  this.drawParallaxLayer(
   context,
   this.backgroundBuildings, // the image for the background layer
   0.8, // scale for the background buildings
   0.6 // rate of movement relative to the foreground
  );

  // Draw foreground buildings on top of the background buildings
  this.drawParallaxLayer(
   context,
   this.foregroundBuildings, // the image for the foreground layer
   0.5, // scale for the foreground buildings
   1 // rate of movement (1 to move at the same rate as the scrolling offset)
  );
  context.globalAlpha = 1; // Set to desired transparency level (0 to 1)
 }
```

How can we move that existing parallax and scaling code over to the new "levels" implementation?

I think we should probably move the existing code out to some kind of levels-background handler, but the `updateCharacterAndBackground` handles frame updates for the background and the character, such as Hero or Zombie.

To integrate your existing parallax and scaling code with the new "levels" implementation, you can create a `ParallaxBackground` component that handles the drawing of the background layers with parallax effects. This component can take in props for the images and parallax rates, which will be provided by the `Level` component based on the current level.

Here's how you might structure the `ParallaxBackground` component:

```tsx
// ParallaxBackground.tsx
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';

interface ParallaxLayer {
  imageSrc: string;
  scale: number;
  movementRate: number;
}

interface ParallaxBackgroundProps {
  layers: ParallaxLayer[];
  offset: number; // This prop is the backgroundOffsetX from your game state
  canvasWidth: number;
  canvasHeight: number;
}

const ParallaxBackground: React.FC<ParallaxBackgroundProps> = ({ layers, offset, canvasWidth, canvasHeight }) => {
  const canvasRef = useRef<HTMLCanvasElement>(null);

  const drawParallaxLayer = (context: CanvasRenderingContext2D, layer: ParallaxLayer) => {
    const { imageSrc, scale, movementRate } = layer;
    const image = new Image();
    image.src = imageSrc;

    // Wait for the image to load before drawing
    image.onload = () => {
      const x = -offset * movementRate;
      // Implement the scaling and drawing logic here
      // ...
    };
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    const canvas = canvasRef.current;
    const context = canvas?.getContext('2d');
    if (context) {
      layers.forEach(layer => drawParallaxLayer(context, layer));
    }
  }, [layers, offset]);

  return (
    <canvas ref={canvasRef} width={canvasWidth} height={canvasHeight} />
  );
};

export default ParallaxBackground;
```

You would use this component in your `Level` component like this:

```tsx
// Level.tsx
import React from 'react';
import ParallaxBackground from './ParallaxBackground';

interface LevelProps {
  level: number;
  backgroundOffsetX: number; // Passed from the parent component (TerminalGame)
  canvasWidth: number;
  canvasHeight: number;
}

export const Level: React.FC<LevelProps> = ({ level, backgroundOffsetX, canvasWidth, canvasHeight }) => {
  const getParallaxLayers = (level: number): ParallaxLayer[] => {
    // Logic to select parallax layers based on the current level
    // Return an array of ParallaxLayer objects
  };

  const layers = getParallaxLayers(level);

  return (
    <ParallaxBackground layers={layers} offset={backgroundOffsetX} canvasWidth={canvasWidth} canvasHeight={canvasHeight} />
    // Other components for characters, HUD, etc.
  );
};
```

And in your `TerminalGame` component, you would manage the state for `backgroundOffsetX` and pass it down to the `Level` component, along with `canvasWidth` and `canvasHeight`.

The `updateCharacterAndBackground` method would remain in `TerminalGame` since it involves updating game state and character positions, which are not directly related to rendering the background layers. You would call this method within your game loop to keep updating the state based on the character's actions.

With this new structure, you've created a clear separation of concerns, where `TerminalGame` manages the game state, `Level` manages the level-specific components, and `ParallaxBackground` is responsible for rendering the parallax background layers. This adheres to modern React best practices and keeps your code organized and modular.

I am trying to fill out the `getParallaxLayers`

```tsx
   const getParallaxLayers = (level: number): ParallaxLayer[] => [
   [{ src: '/images/parallax-industrial-pack/parallax-industrial-pack/layers/skill-desc_0000_foreground.png', scale: 1, movementRate: 1 },

   }],
```

It looks like you're trying to set up an array of `ParallaxLayer[]` for different levels, but the structure of the arrays you've provided is inconsistent. The first array contains objects with `src`, `scale`, and `movementRate` properties, which aligns with the `ParallaxLayer` interface I suggested earlier. However, the second array contains objects with `foregroundSrc`, `backgroundSrc`, and `farBackgroundSrc`, which is different.

To maintain consistency, let's define the `ParallaxLayer` interface and update the `getParallaxLayers` function to return an array of `ParallaxLayer[]` that matches the interface for each level:

```tsx
// Define the ParallaxLayer interface
interface ParallaxLayer {
  imageSrc: string;
  scale: number;
  movementRate: number;
}

// Function to get parallax layers based on the level
const getParallaxLayers = (level: number): ParallaxLayer[][] => {
  const layers: ParallaxLayer[][] = {
    1: [ // Level 1 layers
      { imageSrc: '/images/parallax-industrial-pack/parallax-industrial-pack/layers/skill-desc_0000_foreground.png', scale: 1, movementRate: 1 },
      { imageSrc: '/images/parallax-industrial-pack/parallax-industrial-pack/layers/skill-desc_0001_buildings.png', scale: 0.8, movementRate: 0.6 },
      { imageSrc: '/images/parallax-industrial-pack/parallax-industrial-pack/layers/skill-desc_0002_far-buildings.png', scale: 0.6, movementRate: 0.4 },
    ],
    2: [ // Level 2 layers
      { imageSrc: '/images/cyberpunk-street-files/cyberpunk-street-files/PNG/layers/foreground.png', scale: 1, movementRate: 1 },
      { imageSrc: '/images/cyberpunk-street-files/cyberpunk-street-files/PNG/layers/back-buildings.png', scale: 0.8, movementRate: 0.6 },
      { imageSrc: '/images/cyberpunk-street-files/cyberpunk-street-files/PNG/layers/far-buildings.png', scale: 0.6, movementRate: 0.4 },
    ],
    // Add more levels as needed
  };

  return layers[level] || layers[1]; // Default to level 1 if the specified level doesn't exist
};
```

Now, `getParallaxLayers` returns an array of `ParallaxLayer` objects for each level. You can add more levels by adding more entries to the `layers` object, ensuring each level's array contains `ParallaxLayer` objects with `imageSrc`, `scale`, and `movementRate` properties.

The `Level` component will then use this function to obtain the correct array of layers for the current level and pass it to the `ParallaxBackground` component.

I am getting this error:

```
Type '{ 1: { imageSrc: string; scale: number; movementRate: number; }[]; 2: { imageSrc: string; scale: number; movementRate: number; }[]; }' is missing the following properties from type 'ParallaxLayer[][]': length, pop, push, concat, and 29 more.ts(2740)
```

**Codeium** _at 2:33 pm, Jun 9, 2024_

The error is due to a misunderstanding in the type of the `layers` object. TypeScript is expecting `ParallaxLayer[][]` which is an array of arrays of `ParallaxLayer`. However, you're providing an object with numeric keys where each key corresponds to an array of `ParallaxLayer`.

To fix this error, you could change the structure to use an array of arrays directly, or you could define a type for the layers object. Here's how you can define it using an array of arrays:

```tsx
const getParallaxLayers = (level: number): ParallaxLayer[][] => {
  const layers: ParallaxLayer[][] = [
    // Level 1 layers
    [
      { imageSrc: '/images/parallax-industrial-pack/parallax-industrial-pack/layers/skill-desc_0000_foreground.png', scale: 1, movementRate: 1 },
      { imageSrc: '/images/parallax-industrial-pack/parallax-industrial-pack/layers/skill-desc_0001_buildings.png', scale: 0.8, movementRate: 0.6 },
      { imageSrc: '/images/parallax-industrial-pack/parallax-industrial-pack/layers/skill-desc_0002_far-buildings.png', scale: 0.6, movementRate: 0.4 },
    ],
    // Level 2 layers
    [
      { imageSrc: '/images/cyberpunk-street-files/cyberpunk-street-files/PNG/layers/foreground.png', scale: 1, movementRate: 1 },
      { imageSrc: '/images/cyberpunk-street-files/cyberpunk-street-files/PNG/layers/back-buildings.png', scale: 0.8, movementRate: 0.6 },
      { imageSrc: '/images/cyberpunk-street-files/cyberpunk-street-files/PNG/layers/far-buildings.png', scale: 0.6, movementRate: 0.4 },
    ],
    // Add more levels as needed
  ];

  // Ensure the level index is within bounds, defaulting to level 1 if out of bounds
  const levelIndex = level - 1; // Adjust for zero-based index
  return layers[levelIndex] || layers[0];
};
```

In this implementation, `layers` is an array where each index corresponds to a level, and it contains an array of `ParallaxLayer`. This matches the expected type of `ParallaxLayer[][]`. When you call `getParallaxLayers(level)`, it returns the array of `ParallaxLayer` for the given level, defaulting to the first level's layers if the index is out of bounds.

This should resolve the TypeScript error, and your `getParallaxLayers` function should now work as expected.

I think, then, we want:

```tsx
 const getParallaxLayers = (level: number): ParallaxLayer[] => {
```

since it is returning only one of the arrays.

`getParallaxLayers` is not used in the `Level.tsx` and it is not exported. I think I may have left something out somewhere.

```tsx
// Level.tsx
import React from 'react';
import ParallaxBackground, { ParallaxLayer } from './ParallaxBackground';

interface ILevelProps {
 level: number;
 backgroundOffsetX: number;
 canvasWidth: number;
 canvasHeight: number;
}

export const Level: React.FC<ILevelProps> = ({ level, backgroundOffsetX, canvasWidth, canvasHeight }) => {
 // Function to get parallax layers based on the level
 const getParallaxLayers = (level: number): ParallaxLayer[] => {
  const layers: ParallaxLayer[][] = [
   // Level 1 layers
   [
    { imageSrc: '/images/parallax-industrial-pack/parallax-industrial-pack/layers/skill-desc_0000_foreground.png', scale: 1, movementRate: 1 },
    { imageSrc: '/images/parallax-industrial-pack/parallax-industrial-pack/layers/skill-desc_0001_buildings.png', scale: 0.8, movementRate: 0.6 },
    { imageSrc: '/images/parallax-industrial-pack/parallax-industrial-pack/layers/skill-desc_0002_far-buildings.png', scale: 0.6, movementRate: 0.4 },
   ],
   // Level 2 layers
   [
    { imageSrc: '/images/cyberpunk-street-files/cyberpunk-street-files/PNG/layers/foreground.png', scale: 1, movementRate: 1 },
    { imageSrc: '/images/cyberpunk-street-files/cyberpunk-street-files/PNG/layers/back-buildings.png', scale: 0.8, movementRate: 0.6 },
    { imageSrc: '/images/cyberpunk-street-files/cyberpunk-street-files/PNG/layers/far-buildings.png', scale: 0.6, movementRate: 0.4 },
   ],
   // Add more levels as needed
  ];

  // Ensure the level index is within bounds, defaulting to level 1 if out of bounds
  const levelIndex = level - 1; // Adjust for zero-based index
  return layers[levelIndex] || layers[0];
 };

};
```

You're correct, the `getParallaxLayers` function in `Level.tsx` should return a single array of `ParallaxLayer` corresponding to the specified level. The signature of the function is correct as `ParallaxLayer[]`, and the function is correctly implemented within the `Level` component.

However, you need to use the `getParallaxLayers` function to pass the layers to the `ParallaxBackground` component. Here's how you can integrate it within your `Level` component:

```tsx
// Level.tsx
import React from 'react';
import ParallaxBackground, { ParallaxLayer } from './ParallaxBackground';

interface ILevelProps {
  level: number;
  backgroundOffsetX: number;
  canvasWidth: number;
  canvasHeight: number;
}

export const Level: React.FC<ILevelProps> = ({ level, backgroundOffsetX, canvasWidth, canvasHeight }) => {
  // Function to get parallax layers based on the level
  const getParallaxLayers = (level: number): ParallaxLayer[] => {
    const layers: ParallaxLayer[][] = [
      // Level 1 layers

      // Level 2 layers
      [
        { imageSrc: '/images/cyberpunk-street-files/cyberpunk-street-files/PNG/layers/foreground.png', scale: 1, movementRate: 1 },
        { imageSrc: '/images/cyberpunk-street-files/cyberpunk-street-files/PNG/layers/back-buildings.png', scale: 0.8, movementRate: 0.6 },
        { imageSrc: '/images/cyberpunk-street-files/cyberpunk-street-files/PNG/layers/far-buildings.png', scale: 0.6, movementRate: 0.4 },
      ],
      // Add more levels as needed
    ];

    // Ensure the level index is within bounds, defaulting to level 1 if out of bounds
    const levelIndex = level - 1; // Adjust for zero-based index
    return layers[levelIndex] || layers[0];
  };

  // Use getParallaxLayers to get the layers for the current level
  const layers = getParallaxLayers(level);

  return (
    <>
      <ParallaxBackground layers={layers} offset={backgroundOffsetX} canvasWidth={canvasWidth} canvasHeight={canvasHeight} />
      {/* Render your characters and other level elements here */}
    </>
  );
};
```

Now, within the `Level` component's JSX, you're using the `getParallaxLayers` function to obtain the correct layers for the current level, and passing them as props to the `ParallaxBackground` component.

If you want to make `getParallaxLayers` reusable and accessible from other components, you can move it outside of the `Level` component and export it:

```tsx
// Possibly in a separate file, e.g., getParallaxLayers.ts
export const getParallaxLayers = (level: number): ParallaxLayer[] => {
  // ... same as above
};
```

Then, you can import and use this function in your `Level` component:

```tsx
// Level.tsx
import React from 'react';
import ParallaxBackground from './ParallaxBackground';
import { getParallaxLayers } from './getParallaxLayers'; // Assuming you moved the function to this file

// ... rest of the Level component
``` 

This approach allows you to maintain separation of concerns and makes `getParallaxLayers` accessible to other parts of your application if needed.

I think there is a complication:

The "levels" canvas is rendering in a new canvas, not the one that the character animations are drawn in.

I am guessing that means we have to pass a reference to the `canvasRef` to the `<Level>` component?

---

**Codeium** _at 3:00 pm, Jun 9, 2024_

Yes, that's correct. Since the character animations are being drawn on the same canvas as the parallax backgrounds, you need to ensure that they share the same canvas context. To do this, you can pass the `canvasRef` from the `TerminalGame` component to the `Level` component, which in turn would pass it to the `ParallaxBackground` component.

Here's how you can modify the components to share the same canvas reference:

In `TerminalGame.tsx`, pass the `canvasRef` to the `Level` component:

```tsx
// TerminalGame.tsx

render() {
  // ...
  return (
    <Level
      level={this.state.currentLevel}
      backgroundOffsetX={this.state.backgroundOffsetX}
      canvasWidth={this.props.canvasWidth}
      canvasHeight={this.props.canvasHeight}
      canvasRef={this.canvasRef} // Pass the canvasRef here
    />
    // ...
  );
}
```

In `Level.tsx`, receive the `canvasRef` and pass it to the `ParallaxBackground` component:

```tsx
// Level.tsx

interface ILevelProps {
  level: number;
  backgroundOffsetX: number;
  canvasWidth: number;
  canvasHeight: number;
  canvasRef: React.RefObject<HTMLCanvasElement>; // Add this prop for the canvas reference
}

export const Level: React.FC<ILevelProps> = ({ level, backgroundOffsetX, canvasWidth, canvasHeight, canvasRef }) => {
  // ...
  return (
    <>
      <ParallaxBackground
        layers={layers}
        offset={backgroundOffsetX}
        canvasWidth={canvasWidth}
        canvasHeight={canvasHeight}
        canvasRef={canvasRef} // Pass the canvasRef here
      />
      {/* Render your characters and other level elements here, using the same canvasRef */}
    </>
  );
};
```

Finally, in `ParallaxBackground.tsx`, use the passed `canvasRef` instead of creating a new one:

```tsx
// ParallaxBackground.tsx

interface ParallaxBackgroundProps {
  layers: ParallaxLayer[];
  offset: number;
  canvasWidth: number;
  canvasHeight: number;
  canvasRef: React.RefObject<HTMLCanvasElement>; // Use the passed canvasRef
}

const ParallaxBackground: React.FC<ParallaxBackgroundProps> = ({ layers, offset, canvasWidth, canvasHeight, canvasRef }) => {
  // Remove the useRef line since we're using the passed canvasRef now

  useEffect(() => {
    const canvas = canvasRef.current; // Use the passed canvasRef
    const context = canvas?.getContext('2d');
    if (context) {
      // Your drawing logic using context
    }
  }, [layers, offset, canvasRef]); // Include canvasRef in the dependency array

  // No need to return a <canvas> element here since it's provided by the parent component
};

export default ParallaxBackground;
```

By passing the `canvasRef` through the components, you ensure that all drawing operations for the game (both characters and backgrounds) occur on the same canvas, which is necessary for proper layering and rendering of the game's visuals.

Ok, now I think I need to do something in `TerminalGame` to get the images to show up:

```tsx
 updateCharacterAndBackground() {
  const canvasCenterX = this.props.canvasWidth * this.heroXPercent;
  const characterReachThreshold = canvasCenterX; // Character stays in the middle

  if (!this.hero) return;
  // Get the current horizontal movement from the hero's currentAction state
  const heroDx = this.hero.getCurrentAction().dx / 4; // Assuming this.state.heroAction.dx exists

  // Update character position as usual
  const newHeroPositionX = canvasCenterX;

  // Check if the hero reaches the threshold

  if (newHeroPositionX >= characterReachThreshold) {
   this.isInScrollMode = true;
   // Stop the hero's horizontal movement at the threshold
   this.setState({ heroPosition: { ...this.state.heroPosition, leftX: characterReachThreshold } });

   // Update the background position
   this.updateBackgroundPosition(this.state.backgroundOffsetX + heroDx);
   if (this.zombie4) this.zombie4.position.leftX -= heroDx;
  } else {
   // Update the hero's position normally
   this.setState({ heroPosition: { ...this.state.heroPosition, leftX: newHeroPositionX } });
  }

  // Update zombie positions relative to the backgroundOffsetX
  // Assuming you have a method to update zombies
  // this.updateZombiesPosition();
 }
```

**Codeium** _at 3:10 pm, Jun 9, 2024_

To integrate the `updateCharacterAndBackground` logic with the new `Level` component and ensure the images show up, you'll need to handle the following:

1. Update the background offset state (`this.state.backgroundOffsetX`) based on the hero's movement.
2. Pass the updated background offset to the `Level` component to render the background images with the correct parallax effect.
3. Ensure that the canvas context is being used to draw both the background and the characters.

Here's a high-level summary of what you might need to do:

1. **Update Background Offset State**: Modify `updateCharacterAndBackground` to update the `backgroundOffsetX` state properly.

2. **Pass Background Offset to Level**: Pass `this.state.backgroundOffsetX` to the `Level` component as a prop.

3. **Draw Characters**: Continue to use the canvas context to draw the characters in the `TerminalGame` component.

Here's how the updated code might look like:

```tsx
// TerminalGame.tsx

class TerminalGame extends React.Component<Props, State> {
  canvasRef = React.createRef<HTMLCanvasElement>();

  // Existing logic...

  updateCharacterAndBackground() {
    const canvasCenterX = this.props.canvasWidth * this.heroXPercent;
    const characterReachThreshold = canvasCenterX;
    
    if (!this.hero) return;
    const heroDx = this.hero.getCurrentAction().dx / 4;

    let newBackgroundOffsetX = this.state.backgroundOffsetX;

    // Update character position as usual
    const newHeroPositionX = canvasCenterX;

    // Check if the hero reaches the threshold
    if (newHeroPositionX >= characterReachThreshold) {
      this.isInScrollMode = true;

      // Update the background offset
      newBackgroundOffsetX += heroDx;

      this.setState({
        heroPosition: { ...this.state.heroPosition, leftX: characterReachThreshold },
        backgroundOffsetX: newBackgroundOffsetX, // Update background offset state
      });

      if (this.zombie4) this.zombie4.position.leftX -= heroDx;
    } else {
      this.setState({ heroPosition: { ...this.state.heroPosition, leftX: newHeroPositionX } });
    }

    // Update zombie positions relative to the backgroundOffsetX
    // Assuming you have a method to update zombies
    // this.updateZombiesPosition();
  }

  // Existing logic...

  render() {
    return (
      <>
        <canvas ref={this.canvasRef} width={this.props.canvasWidth} height={this.props.canvasHeight} />
        <Level
          level={this.state.currentLevel}
          backgroundOffsetX={this.state.backgroundOffsetX}
          canvasWidth={this.props.canvasWidth}
          canvasHeight={this.props.canvasHeight}
          canvasRef={this.canvasRef}
        />
        {/* Draw your characters using the canvasRef */}
      </>
    );
  }
}

export default TerminalGame;
```

Make sure to call `updateCharacterAndBackground` within your game loop or an appropriate lifecycle method such as `componentDidUpdate` to continuously update the state based on the hero's movement.

The `Level` component, as previously described, will receive the `backgroundOffsetX` prop and use it to render the parallax background layers accordingly. The canvas context for drawing the characters will remain the same, shared with the `Level` component through the `canvasRef` prop.

I have not implemented this yet:

```tsx
 const drawParallaxLayer = (context: CanvasRenderingContext2D, layer: ParallaxLayer) => {
  const { imageSrc, scale, movementRate } = layer;
  const image = new Image();
  image.src = imageSrc;

  // Wait for the image to load before drawing
  image.onload = () => {
   const x = -offset * movementRate;
   // Implement the scaling and drawing logic here
   // ...
  };
 };
```

How do I do that?

---

**Codeium** _at 3:39 pm, Jun 9, 2024_

The `drawParallaxLayer` function should handle the drawing of each parallax layer onto the canvas. You'll need to implement the logic to scale the image and position it based on the `movementRate`. Here's an example of how you might implement this function:

```tsx
const drawParallaxLayer = (context: CanvasRenderingContext2D, layer: ParallaxLayer, offset: number, canvasWidth: number, canvasHeight: number) => {
  const { imageSrc, scale, movementRate } = layer;
  const image = new Image();
  image.src = imageSrc;

  // Wait for the image to load before drawing
  image.onload = () => {
    // Calculate the horizontal position based on the movement rate
    const x = -offset * movementRate;
    
    // Calculate the scaled dimensions of the image
    const scaledWidth = image.width * scale;
    const scaledHeight = image.height * scale;

    // Calculate how many times to draw the image to fill the canvas width
    const numImages = Math.ceil(canvasWidth / scaledWidth);

    // Draw the image as many times as needed to create the parallax effect
    for (let i = 0; i <= numImages; i++) {
      context.drawImage(
        image,
        x + i * scaledWidth % canvasWidth, // X position (looping the image)
        canvasHeight - scaledHeight,       // Y position (align to bottom)
        scaledWidth,                      // Scaled width
        scaledHeight                      // Scaled height
      );
    }
  };

  // If the image is already loaded (e.g., cached), draw it immediately
  if (image.complete) {
    const x = -offset * movementRate;
    const scaledWidth = image.width * scale;
    const scaledHeight = image.height * scale;
    const numImages = Math.ceil(canvasWidth / scaledWidth);
    for (let i = 0; i <= numImages; i++) {
      context.drawImage(
        image,
        x + i * scaledWidth % canvasWidth,
        canvasHeight - scaledHeight,
        scaledWidth,
        scaledHeight
      );
    }
  }
};
```

This implementation assumes that the image should be looped horizontally to fill the entire canvas width. It scales the image according to the `scale` factor and adjusts its horizontal position (`x`) based on the `movementRate` and the `offset`. 

To use this function within your `ParallaxBackground` component, you'd call it for each layer in the `useEffect` hook:

```tsx
// ParallaxBackground.tsx

const ParallaxBackground: React.FC<ParallaxBackgroundProps> = ({ layers, offset, canvasWidth, canvasHeight, canvasRef }) => {
  useEffect(() => {
    const canvas = canvasRef.current;
    const context = canvas?.getContext('2d');
    if (context) {
      // Clear the canvas before drawing the new frame
      context.clearRect(0, 0, canvasWidth, canvasHeight);

      // Draw each layer
      layers.forEach(layer => drawParallaxLayer(context, layer, offset, canvasWidth, canvasHeight));
    }
  }, [layers, offset, canvasWidth, canvasHeight, canvasRef]);

  // The canvas is rendered by the parent component (TerminalGame)
  return null;
};

export default ParallaxBackground;
```

Note that the canvas element itself is not returned by `ParallaxBackground` because it's already being rendered by the `TerminalGame` component. The `ParallaxBackground` component's sole responsibility is to manage the drawing of the parallax layers on the provided canvas.

It looks like this is being called very often.

```tsx
 const getParallaxLayers = (level: number): ParallaxLayer[] => {
  const layers: ParallaxLayer[][] = [
   // Level 1 layers
   [
    { imageSrc: '/images/parallax-industrial-pack/parallax-industrial-pack/layers/skill-desc_0002_far-buildings.png', scale: 0.8, movementRate: 0.4 },
    { imageSrc: '/images/parallax-industrial-pack/parallax-industrial-pack/layers/skill-desc_0001_buildings.png', scale: 0.6, movementRate: 0.6 },
    { imageSrc: '/images/parallax-industrial-pack/parallax-industrial-pack/layers/skill-desc_0000_foreground.png', scale: 0.5, movementRate: 1 },
   ],
   // Level 2 layers
   [
    { imageSrc: '/images/cyberpunk-street-files/cyberpunk-street-files/PNG/layers/far-buildings.png', scale: 0.6, movementRate: 0.4 },
    { imageSrc: '/images/cyberpunk-street-files/cyberpunk-street-files/PNG/layers/back-buildings.png', scale: 0.8, movementRate: 0.6 },
    { imageSrc: '/images/cyberpunk-street-files/cyberpunk-street-files/PNG/layers/foreground.png', scale: 1, movementRate: 1 },
   ],
   // Add more levels as needed
  ];

  // console.log('getParallaxLayers called with level:', level);
  // Ensure the level index is within bounds, defaulting to level 1 if out of bounds
  const levelIndex = level - 1; // Adjust for zero-based index
  return layers[levelIndex] || layers[0];
 };
```

I think  it might be causing performance issues like a flicker.

---

**Codeium** _at 4:34 pm, Jun 9, 2024_

If `getParallaxLayers` is being called frequently, such as in a render method or an effect hook without proper dependencies, it can lead to performance issues. To resolve this, you should ensure that this function is called only when necessary. Here are some steps to improve performance:

1. **Memoize the Layers**: Use `React.useMemo` to memoize the layers so that they are only recalculated when the level changes.

2. **Optimize Image Loading**: Instead of creating new `Image` objects on every draw call, preload the images and draw them from the preloaded instances.

Here's how you might implement these improvements:

### Memoize the Layers

In `Level.tsx`, memoize the result of `getParallaxLayers`:

```tsx
export const Level: React.FC<ILevelProps> = ({ level, backgroundOffsetX, canvasWidth, canvasHeight, canvasRef }) => {
  const layers = React.useMemo(() => getParallaxLayers(level), [level]);
  // ...
};
```

### Optimize Image Loading

Create a custom hook to preload images and only update when the layers change:

```tsx
const usePreloadedImages = (layers: ParallaxLayer[]) => {
  const [images, setImages] = React.useState<HTMLImageElement[]>([]);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    const preloadedImages: HTMLImageElement[] = [];
    let imagesLoaded = 0;

    const handleImageLoad = () => {
      imagesLoaded += 1;
      if (imagesLoaded === layers.length) {
        setImages(preloadedImages);
      }
    };

    layers.forEach(layer => {
      const image = new Image();
      image.onload = handleImageLoad;
      image.src = layer.imageSrc;
      preloadedImages.push(image);
    });

    // Set images directly if they are cached and loaded immediately
    if (preloadedImages.every(img => img.complete)) {
      setImages(preloadedImages);
    }
  }, [layers]); // Only run when layers change

  return images;
};
```

In `ParallaxBackground.tsx`, use this hook and draw from preloaded images:

```tsx
const ParallaxBackground: React.FC<ParallaxBackgroundProps> = ({ layers, offset, canvasWidth, canvasHeight, canvasRef }) => {
  const preloadedImages = usePreloadedImages(layers);

  // ... (rest of your component)

  useEffect(() => {
    const canvas = canvasRef.current;
    const context = canvas?.getContext('2d');
    if (context && preloadedImages.length === layers.length) {
      context.clearRect(0, 0, canvasWidth, canvasHeight);
      layers.forEach((layer, index) => {
        drawParallaxLayer(context, layer, preloadedImages[index], offset, canvasWidth, canvasHeight);
      });
    }
  }, [preloadedImages, layers, offset, canvasWidth, canvasHeight, canvasRef]);

  // The canvas is rendered by the parent component (TerminalGame)
  return null;
};

// Update drawParallaxLayer to accept a preloaded image instead of creating a new one
const drawParallaxLayer = (
  context: CanvasRenderingContext2D,
  layer: ParallaxLayer,
  image: HTMLImageElement,
  offset: number,
  canvasWidth: number,
  canvasHeight: number
) => {
  // ... (your existing drawing logic, but using the preloaded `image` instead of creating a new Image)
};
```

With these optimizations, the `getParallaxLayers` function and image loading will only be triggered when the level changes, which should help reduce flickering and improve performance.

Your "Memoize the Layers" code declares `const layers` again:

```tsx
Cannot redeclare block-scoped variable 'layers'.ts(2451)
⚠ Error(TS2451)  | 
Cannot redeclare block-scoped variable layers .
```

What is the simplest way to fix that?

---

**Codeium** _at 4:39 pm, Jun 9, 2024_

Apologies for the oversight. The redeclaration error happens because `layers` is already declared in the `Level` component. The simplest fix is to remove the redundant `const layers` declaration from the `useMemo` call and instead use that memoized value directly in your component.

Here is the corrected snippet for the `Level` component with proper memoization:

```tsx
export const Level: React.FC<ILevelProps> = ({ level, backgroundOffsetX, canvasWidth, canvasHeight, canvasRef }) => {
  // Memoize the layers to prevent unnecessary recalculations
  const layers = React.useMemo(() => {
    // Define getParallaxLayers inside useMemo to capture the `level` variable
    const getParallaxLayers = (level: number): ParallaxLayer[] => {
      const layers: ParallaxLayer[][] = [
        // Level 1 layers
        [
          // ... Level 1 definitions
        ],
        // Level 2 layers
        [
          // ... Level 2 definitions
        ],
        // Add more levels as needed
      ];

      // Ensure the level index is within bounds, defaulting to level 1 if out of bounds
      const levelIndex = level - 1; // Adjust for zero-based index
      return layers[levelIndex] || layers[0];
    };

    return getParallaxLayers(level);
  }, [level]);

  // ... rest of the component
};
```

With this change, `getParallaxLayers` is defined inside the `useMemo` hook, and the memoized result is stored in the `layers` constant. This ensures that `layers` is only recalculated when the `level` prop changes. The rest of the `Level` component remains the same, and you continue to pass `layers` to the `ParallaxBackground` component as a prop.

That is better. There doesn't seem to be flicker.

However, the Zombie leaves a smear of the Zombie image as it moves across the canvas., and the background doesn't move when the Hero runs.

---

**Codeium** _at 4:45 pm, Jun 9, 2024_

The "smearing" effect of the Zombie character likely occurs because the canvas is not being cleared before each new frame is drawn. The background not moving could be due to the `backgroundOffsetX` not being updated or applied properly. Here are the steps to resolve these issues:

### Clearing the Canvas

Ensure that the canvas is cleared at the beginning of each frame update. This is typically done in the game loop or wherever you handle your rendering logic.

```tsx
const context = canvasRef.current.getContext('2d');
if (context) {
  context.clearRect(0, 0, canvasRef.current.width, canvasRef.current.height);
  // ... draw your frame
}
```

### Updating the Background Position

Make sure `backgroundOffsetX` is updated appropriately when the Hero moves. If `backgroundOffsetX` is not changing, the background won't move. Check the logic in `updateCharacterAndBackground` to ensure it updates `backgroundOffsetX` when the Hero reaches the threshold.

### Applying `backgroundOffsetX` to the Background Layers

Ensure that the `backgroundOffsetX` is being used to calculate the position of each parallax layer within the `drawParallaxLayer` function. If `backgroundOffsetX` is not taken into account, the background will not scroll.

### Example Implementation

Here's an example of how the drawing logic inside the `ParallaxBackground` component should look, taking the `backgroundOffsetX` into account:

```tsx
// ParallaxBackground.tsx

const ParallaxBackground: React.FC<ParallaxBackgroundProps> = ({ layers, offset, canvasWidth, canvasHeight, canvasRef }) => {
  const drawFrame = () => {
    const canvas = canvasRef.current;
    const context = canvas?.getContext('2d');
    if (context) {
      context.clearRect(0, 0, canvasWidth, canvasHeight);
      layers.forEach(layer => {
        drawParallaxLayer(context, layer, offset, canvasWidth, canvasHeight);
      });
      // Draw your characters here after the background
      // For example:
      // drawZombie(context, zombieState);
      // drawHero(context, heroState);
    }
  };

  // Call drawFrame whenever you need to update the game state
  // For example, using requestAnimationFrame in a game loop
  useEffect(() => {
    const animationFrame = requestAnimationFrame(drawFrame);
    return () => cancelAnimationFrame(animationFrame);
  }, [layers, offset, canvasWidth, canvasHeight, canvasRef]);

  // The canvas is rendered by the parent component (TerminalGame)
  return null;
};
```

Make sure that `drawFrame` is called repeatedly, like in a game loop, usually done with `requestAnimationFrame`. The `useEffect` hook with `requestAnimationFrame` ensures that `drawFrame` is called before the browser repaints, which typically happens at about 60 times per second.

By clearing the canvas and using the updated `backgroundOffsetX` for drawing your layers and characters, you should no longer see the smearing effect, and the background should move as expected when the Hero runs.

I am not sure how to implement `drawParallaxLayer` in ``TerminalGame`. I think it must go in `startAnimationLoop` or `updatecharacterAndBackground`.

The `drawParallaxLayer` function should be called from within the animation loop of your game to draw the background. It should be done before drawing the characters to ensure that the characters are rendered on top of the background.

It's generally best to separate concerns: `updateCharacterAndBackground` should handle updating the game state (positions, actions, etc.), while the drawing should be done in the `startAnimationLoop` method.

Here's how you might incorporate `drawParallaxLayer` into `startAnimationLoop` in `TerminalGame`:

```tsx
startAnimationLoop() {
  const loop = (timestamp: number) => {
    if (!this.gameTime) {
      this.gameTime = timestamp; // Initialize gameTime on the first animation frame
    }

    const elapsedTime = timestamp - this.gameTime;
    this.gameTime = timestamp; // Update gameTime for the next frame

    const context = this.canvasRef.current.getContext('2d');
    if (context) {
      context.clearRect(0, 0, context.canvas.width, context.canvas.height);

      // Update the game state, such as character positions and background offset
      this.updateCharacterAndBackground();

      // Draw the parallax background layers
      this.props.layers.forEach(layer => {
        drawParallaxLayer(context, layer, this.state.backgroundOffsetX, this.props.canvasWidth, this.props.canvasHeight);
      });

      // Draw characters and other game elements
      // This could be a separate function like `this.drawCharacters(context)`

      // TODO: Draw your Zombie and Hero here
      // if (this.zombie4) this.drawZombie(context, this.zombie4);
      // if (this.hero) this.drawHero(context, this.hero);
    }

    // Continue the loop
    requestAnimationFrame(this.startAnimationloop);
  };

  // Start the loop
  requestAnimationFrame(loop);
}
```

Make sure `drawParallaxLayer` is implemented in such a way that it uses the `context` from the canvas reference and `this.state.backgroundOffsetX` to calculate the position of the background layers. Also, ensure that `props.layers` contains the correct information about the background layers.

The `drawParallaxLayer` function will need access to the `ParallaxLayer` type and the `drawParallaxLayer` implementation, which you may need to import or define within the `TerminalGame` module.

Keep in mind that the code snippet provided is a simplification and you will need to integrate it with your existing game loop logic and state management. Additionally, you should ensure that `drawParallaxLayer` does not create new `Image` objects on each call; instead, use preloaded images for performance reasons, as discussed previously.

I don't the the `layers` are being passed in to `TerminalGame` as `props` at this point.

If `layers` are not being passed as props, you will need to define them within `TerminalGame` or obtain them from another source. Since `TerminalGame` is responsible for rendering the game, it would make sense to have the layers information available there.

Given that `layers` are specific to levels, you could retrieve them using the `getParallaxLayers` function based on the current level of the game. You may also consider storing the preloaded images for these layers in the state if they are not changing frequently.

Here's a potential approach to include `layers` within `TerminalGame`:

```tsx
class TerminalGame extends React.Component<Props, State> {
  canvasRef = React.createRef<HTMLCanvasElement>();
  // ...

  startAnimationLoop() {
    const loop = (timestamp: number) => {
      // ... existing loop code

      const context = this.canvasRef.current.getContext('2d');
      if (context) {
        context.clearRect(0, 0, context.canvas.width, context.canvas.height);

        // Get the parallax layers for the current level
        const layers = getParallaxLayers(this.state.currentLevel);

        // Draw the parallax background layers
        layers.forEach(layer => {
          drawParallaxLayer(context, layer, this.state.backgroundOffsetX, this.props.canvasWidth, this.props.canvasHeight);
        });

        // ... draw characters and other game elements
      }

      // Continue the loop
      requestAnimationFrame(this.startAnimationLoop);
    };

    // Start the loop
    requestAnimationFrame(loop);
  }

  // ...
}
```

Make sure `getParallaxLayers` is available in the `TerminalGame` context, which means you might need to import it or move its definition to an appropriate place. Additionally, ensure that the `drawParallaxLayer` function is optimized to use preloaded images, as creating new `Image` objects on each call can be very inefficient and lead to performance issues.

Lastly, if your game has multiple levels and you expect the background layers to change, you should manage the layer data and the preloaded images accordingly, updating them only when the level changes.

Remember that you will also need to pass the `layers` to the `Level` component if it's responsible for handling background rendering. If that's the case, `layers` could be part of the state in `TerminalGame`, and you would pass them down to `Level` as props.

Should I export `drawParallaxLayer`? Or should it be static?

---

**Codeium** _at 5:54 pm, Jun 9, 2024_

If the `drawParallaxLayer` function is specific to the `ParallaxBackground` component and not used elsewhere, you don't necessarily need to export it. Keeping it as a private helper function within the same module can be perfectly fine. However, if you need to use this function in other components, like `TerminalGame`, then you would need to export it.

Regarding whether it should be static, in React and functional programming in general, you typically don't use static methods in the same way you might in class-based object-oriented programming. Instead, you export functions that are not tied to any particular instance of a component.

Here's how you could handle both cases:

### Private Helper Function in `ParallaxBackground.tsx`
Keep the function in `ParallaxBackground.tsx` without exporting it if it's only used there.
```tsx
// ParallaxBackground.tsx
const drawParallaxLayer = (
  context: CanvasRenderingContext2D,
  layer: ParallaxLayer,
  offset: number,
  canvasWidth: number,
  canvasHeight: number
) => {
  // Drawing logic...
};

// No export needed if the function is only used within this module.
```

### Exported Function for Use in Other Components
If you want to use the function in `TerminalGame` or other components, you should export it.
```tsx
// ParallaxBackground.tsx
export const drawParallaxLayer = (
  context: CanvasRenderingContext2D,
  layer: ParallaxLayer,
  offset: number,
  canvasWidth: number,
  canvasHeight: number
) => {
  // Drawing logic...
};

// Now it's exported and can be imported in TerminalGame.tsx
```

And then you would import it in `TerminalGame.tsx` like so:
```tsx
// TerminalGame.tsx
import { drawParallaxLayer } from './ParallaxBackground';

// Use drawParallaxLayer as needed...
```

Choose the approach that best fits your project structure and the reusability requirements of the `drawParallaxLayer` function. If you find that you're using the function in multiple places and it doesn't rely on any internal state of `ParallaxBackground`, then exporting it is the way to go. This allows you to maintain the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle by having a single source of truth for the drawing logic of your parallax layers.

The code you posted earlier implies that `drawParallaxLayers` be exported and that there should be an additional function `getParallaxLayers`

```tsx
        // Get the parallax layers for the current level
        const layers = getParallaxLayers(this.state.currentLevel);

        // Draw the parallax background layers
        layers.forEach(layer => {
          drawParallaxLayer(context, layer, this.state.backgroundOffsetX, this.props.canvasWidth, this.props.canvasHeight);
        });
```

You said I could store the layers in the state if they are not changing often. I would like to do that.

---

**Codeium** _at 6:02 pm, Jun 9, 2024_

Storing the parallax layers in the state of `TerminalGame` is a good strategy if they don't change often, as it will prevent unnecessary recalculations of the layers array. Here's how you can do that:

1. Initialize the layers in the state of `TerminalGame` when the component mounts or when the level changes.
2. Update the `drawParallaxLayer` calls to use the layers from the state.
3. Ensure that `getParallaxLayers` and `drawParallaxLayer` are accessible by `TerminalGame` either by importing them or defining them in the same file.

Here's an example of how to modify `TerminalGame`:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { drawParallaxLayer } from './ParallaxBackground'; // Assuming drawParallaxLayer is exported
import { getParallaxLayers } from './someModule'; // Assuming getParallaxLayers is exported and implemented correctly

class TerminalGame extends React.Component<Props, State> {
  canvasRef = React.createRef<HTMLCanvasElement>();
  state = {
    // ...other state properties
    layers: [],
  };

  componentDidMount() {
    this.setParallaxLayers();
  }

  componentDidUpdate(prevProps: Props, prevState: State) {
    // Check if the level has changed, and update layers if it has
    if (this.state.currentLevel !== prevState.currentLevel) {
      this.setParallaxLayers();
    }
  }

  setParallaxLayers() {
    const layers = getParallaxLayers(this.state.currentLevel);
    this.setState({ layers });
  }

  startAnimationLoop() {
    const loop = (timestamp: number) => {
      // ...existing loop code

      const context = this.canvasRef.current.getContext('2d');
      if (context) {
        context.clearRect(0, 0, context.canvas.width, context.canvas.height);

        // Draw the parallax background layers using layers from state
        this.state.layers.forEach(layer => {
          drawParallaxLayer(context, layer, this.state.backgroundOffsetX, this.props.canvasWidth, this.props.canvasHeight);
        });

        // ... draw characters and other game elements
      }

      // Continue the loop
      requestAnimationFrame(this.startAnimationLoop);
    };

    // Start the loop
    requestAnimationFrame(loop);
  }

  // ...
}

export default TerminalGame;
```

In the example above, `getParallaxLayers` is called in `setParallaxLayers`, which is invoked during `componentDidMount` and whenever the current level changes, as detected in `componentDidUpdate`. This updates the `layers` state only when necessary.

Please note that `drawParallaxLayer` and `getParallaxLayers` need to be imported from their respective modules if they are not defined in the same file as `TerminalGame`. Also, ensure that `getParallaxLayers` is implemented to return the correct layers for the given level.

By managing the layers in the state, you minimize the number of operations performed, which can lead to better performance and a smoother experience.

You recommended using a `getParallaxLayers` function, but provided no information on where to create such a function.

How would I do that?

---

**Codeium** _at 6:05 pm, Jun 9, 2024_

The `getParallaxLayers` function should return an array of `ParallaxLayer` objects based on the current level. If the layers data is static, it can be defined outside of your components, perhaps in a separate utility file or directly within the `TerminalGame` file if it's not used elsewhere.

Here's an example of how you could define `getParallaxLayers` in a separate file named `parallaxLayers.ts`:

```typescript
// parallaxLayers.ts
import { ParallaxLayer } from './ParallaxBackground';

// Define all your layers for each level
const layersData: ParallaxLayer[][] = [
  // Level 1 layers
  [
    { imageSrc: '/path/to/level1/foreground.png', scale: 1, movementRate: 1 },
    { imageSrc: '/path/to/level1/midground.png', scale: 0.8, movementRate: 0.6 },
    { imageSrc: '/path/to/level1/background.png', scale: 0.6, movementRate: 0.3 },
    // ... other layers for level 1
  ],
  // Level 2 layers
  [
    { imageSrc: '/path/to/level2/foreground.png', scale: 1, movementRate: 1 },
    { imageSrc: '/path/to/level2/midground.png', scale: 0.8, movementRate: 0.6 },
    { imageSrc: '/path/to/level2/background.png', scale: 0.6, movementRate: 0.3 },
    // ... other layers for level 2
  ],
  // ... more levels
];

export const getParallaxLayers = (level: number): ParallaxLayer[] => {
  // Ensure the level is within the bounds of the layersData array
  const levelIndex = Math.max(0, Math.min(level - 1, layersData.length - 1));
  return layersData[levelIndex];
};
```

Then, in your `TerminalGame` component, you can import and use this function:

```typescript
// TerminalGame.tsx
import { getParallaxLayers } from './parallaxLayers';
// ... other imports

class TerminalGame extends React.Component<Props, State> {
  // ... existing code

  componentDidMount() {
    this.setParallaxLayers();
  }

  componentDidUpdate(prevProps: Props, prevState: State) {
    if (this.state.currentLevel !== prevState.currentLevel) {
      this.setParallaxLayers();
    }
  }

  setParallaxLayers() {
    const layers = getParallaxLayers(this.state.currentLevel);
    this.setState({ layers });
  }

  // ... rest of the component
}
```

By structuring your code this way, you maintain a clean separation of concerns. The `getParallaxLayers` function is solely responsible for providing the correct layers based on the level, while `TerminalGame` manages the game state and rendering logic.

Oh, I think I see it in `Levels.tsx`

Is this the one? I have it exporting now.

```tsx
export const getParallaxLayers = (level: number): IParallaxLayer[] => {
 const layers: IParallaxLayer[][] = [
  // Level 1 layers
  [
   { imageSrc: '/images/parallax-industrial-pack/parallax-industrial-pack/layers/skill-desc_0002_far-buildings.png', scale: 0.8, movementRate: 0.4 },
   { imageSrc: '/images/parallax-industrial-pack/parallax-industrial-pack/layers/skill-desc_0001_buildings.png', scale: 0.6, movementRate: 0.6 },
   { imageSrc: '/images/parallax-industrial-pack/parallax-industrial-pack/layers/skill-desc_0000_foreground.png', scale: 0.5, movementRate: 1 },
  ],
  // Level 2 layers
  [
   { imageSrc: '/images/cyberpunk-street-files/cyberpunk-street-files/PNG/layers/far-buildings.png', scale: 0.6, movementRate: 0.4 },
   { imageSrc: '/images/cyberpunk-street-files/cyberpunk-street-files/PNG/layers/back-buildings.png', scale: 0.8, movementRate: 0.6 },
   { imageSrc: '/images/cyberpunk-street-files/cyberpunk-street-files/PNG/layers/foreground.png', scale: 1, movementRate: 1 },
  ],
  // Add more levels as needed
 ];

 // console.log('getParallaxLayers called with level:', level);
 // Ensure the level index is within bounds, defaulting to level 1 if out of bounds
 const levelIndex = level - 1; // Adjust for zero-based index
 return layers[levelIndex] || layers[0];
};
```

Yes, that looks like the `getParallaxLayers` function from your `Level.tsx` file that you mentioned earlier. Since it's already defined there and now you've exported it, you can import `getParallaxLayers` in your `TerminalGame` component to use it.

Here's how you might import and use it in your `TerminalGame` component:

```tsx
// TerminalGame.tsx
import React from 'react';
import { getParallaxLayers } from './Level'; // Adjust the import path as necessary

class TerminalGame extends React.Component<Props, State> {
  // ... other methods and lifecycle hooks

  componentDidMount() {
    this.setParallaxLayers();
  }

  componentDidUpdate(prevProps: Props, prevState: State) {
    if (this.state.currentLevel !== prevState.currentLevel) {
      this.setParallaxLayers();
    }
  }

  setParallaxLayers() {
    const layers = getParallaxLayers(this.state.currentLevel);
    this.setState({ layers });
  }

  // ... rest of the component
}

export default TerminalGame;
```

Now, whenever the level changes in the `TerminalGame` component's state, the `getParallaxLayers` function will be called, and the layers for the current level will be stored in the state. You can then use those layers within your rendering logic to draw the parallax background.

Remember that if `getParallaxLayers` is being imported from a different place than `Level.tsx`, you'll need to adjust the import path accordingly.

I am trying everything I know in `startAnimationLoop` but the Zombie image still smears and the Hero doesn't cause the background ot move.

```tsx
 startAnimationLoop(context: CanvasRenderingContext2D) {
  const loop = (timestamp: number) => {
   if (!this.gameTime) {
    this.gameTime = timestamp; // Initialize gameTime on the first animation frame
   }

   this.gameTime = timestamp; // Update gameTime for the next frame

   context.clearRect(0, 0, context.canvas.width, context.canvas.height);

   this.updateCharacterAndBackground();
   // Get the parallax layers for the current level

   const layers = this.state.layers;
   // context.clearRect(0, 0, context.canvas.width, context.canvas.height);
   // Draw the parallax background layers
   context.save();
   layers.forEach(layer => {
    drawParallaxLayer(context, layer, this.state.backgroundOffsetX, this.props.canvasWidth, this.props.canvasHeight);
   });
   context.restore();

   if (this.state.isPhraseComplete) {
    this.drawScrollingText(context);
   }
   // Reset globalAlpha if other drawings should not be affected
   context.globalAlpha = 1.0;

   if (this.drawHero) {
    this.drawHero(this.state.heroPosition);
   }
   if (this.drawZombie4) {
    this.drawZombie4(this.state.zombie4Position);
   }

   // Save the request ID to be able to cancel it
   this.animationFrameIndex = requestAnimationFrame(loop);
   this.checkProximityAndSetAction();
  };

  // Start the animation loop
  this.animationFrameIndex = requestAnimationFrame(loop);
 }
```

The smearing issue with the Zombie image likely persists because the position of the Zombie is not being updated correctly within the animation loop, or the image is not being cleared from its previous position before being redrawn.

The background not moving when the Hero runs might be due to the `backgroundOffsetX` state not being updated properly when the Hero moves, or the `drawParallaxLayer` function not utilizing the `backgroundOffsetX` correctly.

Here are a few things to review and check:

1. Make sure `updateCharacterAndBackground` updates the `backgroundOffsetX` correctly when the Hero moves.
2. Check that the `drawZombie4` function clears the previous image of the Zombie before drawing it in the new position.
3. Ensure that `drawParallaxLayer` uses the `backgroundOffsetX` to calculate the position of the layers correctly.

4. Ensure `requestAnimationFrame` is called with the correct instance of the loop function. If `startAnimationLoop` is an instance method, you should bind it to the correct `this` context or use an arrow function to preserve `this`.

Here's a revised version of your `startAnimationLoop` method with points to consider. Make sure to include any missing parts:

```tsx
startAnimationLoop(context: CanvasRenderingContext2D) {
  const loop = (timestamp: number) => {
    if (!this.gameTime) {
      this.gameTime = timestamp; // Initialize gameTime on the first animation frame
    }

    this.gameTime = timestamp; // Update gameTime for the next frame

    context.clearRect(0, 0, context.canvas.width, context.canvas.height);

    // Update game state, including characters and background position
    this.updateCharacterAndBackground();

    // Draw the parallax background layers using the updated offset
    const layers = this.state.layers;
    layers.forEach(layer => {
      drawParallaxLayer(context, layer, this.state.backgroundOffsetX, this.props.canvasWidth, this.props.canvasHeight);
    });

    // Draw hero and zombie
    if (this.state.heroPosition) {
      this.drawHero(context, this.state.heroPosition); // Make sure drawHero is correctly implemented
    }
    if (this.state.zombie4Position) {
      this.drawZombie4(context, this.state.zombie4Position); // Make sure drawZombie4 is correctly implemented
    }

    // Additional drawing logic...
    // ...

    // Save the request ID and continue the loop
    this.animationFrameIndex = requestAnimationFrame(loop);
  };

  // Start the animation loop
  this.animationFrameIndex = requestAnimationFrame(loop);
}
```

In the `drawZombie4` and `drawHero` functions, make sure that you're using `context.clearRect` or drawing a background over the previous position of the characters to prevent smearing. For example:

```tsx
drawZombie4(context: CanvasRenderingContext2D, position: ZombiePosition) {
  // Clear the previous position of the Zombie
  context.clearRect(position.prevX, position.prevY, zombieWidth, zombieHeight);

  // Draw the Zombie at the new position
  // ...
}
```

Remember to update the `prevX` and `prevY` properties to the current position after drawing the Zombie so that you can clear it properly in the next frame.

Also, double-check that the `drawParallaxLayer` function is correctly adjusting the position of the background layers based on `backgroundOffsetX`. If `backgroundOffsetX` is not changing or not being applied, the background will not move as expected.

Lastly, ensure that `this.checkProximityAndSetAction()` is correctly handling the interaction between the Hero and the Zombie. If the Hero or Zombie positions are not updated correctly, it could also lead to rendering issues.
