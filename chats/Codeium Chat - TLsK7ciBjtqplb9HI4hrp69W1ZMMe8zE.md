I have gotten this React Vite TypeScript `xterm.js` app working fairly well, with your help.

Now I am ready to start working on the reason I created the terminal app, which is a terminal typing game.

I already have a WPM monitor and a phrase generator and phrase completion progress shower.

Now I have added a `<canvas>` element to render some rudimentary graphics to gamify getting the user to type faster. I need your help with that. 

It's already showing the canvas, which is only 100px high. 

How can I start rendering a couple graphic items?

To render graphics on your canvas, you'll need to get a reference to the canvas's drawing context and use its methods to draw shapes, text, and images. Here's a basic example of how you could render a rectangle and some text on your canvas:

First, ensure you have a reference to the canvas element. Since you mentioned you have a `canvasRef` in `TerminalGame.tsx`, you can use it to get the context:

```tsx
// TerminalGame.tsx

class TerminalGame extends React.Component<ITerminalGameProps> {
  // Assuming you have a canvasRef defined and assigned to your canvas element
  canvasRef = React.createRef<HTMLCanvasElement>();

  drawGraphics = () => {
    const canvas = this.canvasRef.current;
    if (canvas) {
      const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
      if (ctx) {
        // Clear the canvas
        ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);

        // Set properties for the rectangle
        ctx.fillStyle = 'blue';
        ctx.fillRect(10, 10, 150, 80); // Draw a blue rectangle

        // Set properties for the text
        ctx.fillStyle = 'white';
        ctx.font = '20px Arial';
        ctx.fillText('Type faster!', 20, 50); // Draw text
      }
    }
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this.drawGraphics();
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <canvas
        ref={this.canvasRef}
        width="100%"
        height={this.props.canvasHeight}
      />
    );
  }
}
```

Here's what's happening in this example:

1. The `drawGraphics` method gets the canvas context and uses it to draw a blue rectangle and some white text saying "Type faster!".
2. The `componentDidMount` lifecycle method calls `drawGraphics` to draw the graphics when the component is first mounted.
3. The `render` method returns the `canvas` JSX with a `ref` to get the DOM element and the `height` prop to set its height.

You can expand the `drawGraphics` method to render more complex graphics, animations, or even react to user typing to make your game more interactive. Remember to adjust the canvas `width` and `height` properties as needed to accommodate your game's visual elements.

"100%" doesn't seem to work as a width. It just sets it to 100px.

How can I make the canvas 100% of the width of the page width and responsively?

To make the canvas element take 100% of the width of its container in a responsive way, you can set the width of the canvas in the `drawGraphics` method using the `offsetWidth` of the canvas's parent element. You'll also need to handle window resize events to adjust the canvas size when the browser window is resized.

Here's how you can modify the `TerminalGame` component to achieve this:

```tsx
class TerminalGame extends React.Component<ITerminalGameProps> {
  canvasRef = React.createRef<HTMLCanvasElement>();

  drawGraphics = () => {
    const canvas = this.canvasRef.current;
    if (canvas && canvas.parentElement) {
      // Set canvas width to parent element's width
      canvas.width = canvas.parentElement.offsetWidth;

      const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
      if (ctx) {
        // Your existing drawing code...
      }
    }
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this.drawGraphics();
    // Add resize event listener to update canvas on resize
    window.addEventListener('resize', this.drawGraphics);
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    // Remove resize event listener when the component is unmounted
    window.removeEventListener('resize', this.drawGraphics);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <canvas
        ref={this.canvasRef}
        height={this.props.canvasHeight}
        style={{ width: '100%', height: this.props.canvasHeight }}
      />
    );
  }
}
```

In this update:

- The `drawGraphics` method now sets the `canvas.width` to the `offsetWidth` of the canvas's parent element.
- The `componentDidMount` lifecycle method adds a resize event listener that will call `drawGraphics` when the window is resized.
- The `componentWillUnmount` lifecycle method removes the resize event listener to prevent memory leaks and errors.
- The `render` method sets the `style` prop of the canvas to use CSS width `100%` to ensure it takes the full width of its container. The `height` is set using the `canvasHeight` prop passed to the component.

Please note that setting the canvas `width` and `height` through the `style` attribute or CSS does not actually change the drawing buffer size; it only scales the canvas element. That's why we set the `width` directly on the canvas DOM element in the `drawGraphics` method to ensure the correct drawing buffer size.
