summary: In this chat, the user asked for CSS assistance to style an HTML element `<dl>` with `<dt>` and `<dd>` tags to display side by side with a title. The user also inquired about placing two tables side by side, each containing `<dt>` and `<dd>` elements on a single line within a flexbox layout. The assistant provided CSS code snippets and structural HTML suggestions to address these requirements, ensuring proper alignment and layout of the elements.

I have an element like this, but I want it to have a title and I want the `<dt>` and `<dd>` to display on the same line. The `<dd>` is a number with two decimal places so it should right justify.

```html
<dl id="Lowest WPMs"><dt>t</dt><dd>0.00</dd><dt>e</dt><dd>89.55</dd><dt>s</dt><dd>75.00</dd><dt>t</dt><dd>99.17</dd><dt>
</dt><dd>32.09</dd></dl>
```

You can achieve this by adding a CSS rule to display `<dt>` and `<dd>` inline and aligning the text of `<dd>` to the right. Add the following CSS to your stylesheet:

```css
#Lowest-WPMs dt,
#Lowest-WPMs dd {
  display: inline-block;
  vertical-align: middle;
}

#Lowest-WPMs dd {
  text-align: right;
  min-width: 50px; /* Adjust width as needed */
}

#Lowest-WPMs dt {
  margin-right: 10px; /* Space between dt and dd */
}
```

For the title, you can add a `<div>` or `<h*>` tag above the `<dl>`:

```tsx
<div>
  <h3>Lowest WPMs</h3>
  <dl id="Lowest-WPMs">
    {/* ... your dt and dd elements ... */}
  </dl>
</div>
```

Make sure to correct the ID in the HTML to match the CSS (`"Lowest WPMs"` should be `"Lowest-WPMs"` since spaces are not valid in IDs). Adjust the CSS and HTML as needed for your specific layout requirements.

I am going to put two of these tables on a single row. One with the slowest characters, and one with the fasted characters.

I want each `<dt>` to display on the same row as it's corresponding `<dd>` within each table.

```html
<div><pre>slowest-characters</pre><dl id="slowest-characters" class="wpm-table"><dt>t</dt><dd>0.00</dd><dt>e</dt><dd>120.00</dd><dt>s</dt><dd>54.55</dd><dt>t</dt><dd>123.71</dd><dt>
</dt><dd>39.22</dd></dl></div>
```

To align each `<dt>` with its corresponding `<dd>` on the same line and to have two tables side by side, you can use a flexbox layout for the `<dl>`. Here's how you can structure your HTML and CSS:

```html
<div class="wpm-table-container">
  <div>
    <h3>Slowest Characters</h3>
    <dl id="slowest-characters" class="wpm-table">
      {/* ... your dt and dd elements ... */}
    </dl>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>Fastest Characters</h3>
    <dl id="fastest-characters" class="wpm-table">
      {/* ... your dt and dd elements ... */}
    </dl>
  </div>
</div>
```

And for the CSS:

```css
.wpm-table-container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between; /* Or any other spacing you prefer */
}

.wpm-table {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.wpm-table dt,
.wpm-table dd {
  display: inline-block;
}

.wpm-table dt {
  margin-right: 10px; /* Space between dt and dd */
}

.wpm-table dd {
  text-align: right;
  min-width: 50px; /* Adjust width as needed */
}

/* You might want to add some styles for the individual containers if needed */
.wpm-table-container > div {
  flex: 1; /* This makes both divs take equal space */
  padding: 0 10px; /* Optional padding between tables */
}
```

This CSS will create two flex containers side by side that each contain a title and a definition list. Each `dt` and `dd` will be displayed inline within their own flex container, and the `dd` elements will align to the right. Adjust the CSS as needed for your specific design requirements.
