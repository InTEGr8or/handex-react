summary: Summary: User asked for a CSS solution to create a layout where a list of `<div>` elements have the width of the widest element, align in rows and columns, but float left on the last row. Codeium recommended using `display: inline-block` for the `<div>` elements within a container with `text-align: left;`. Custom CSS styling was provided to achieve the desired layout.

What is the easiest way in CSS to get a list of `<div>` elements to have a width of the widest element, and align in rows and columns, but to float left on the last row?

To achieve the layout you're describing, you can use `display: inline-block` for the `<div>` elements and set the container to `text-align: left;`. This will make each `<div>` take up only as much width as its content and align them in rows and columns, with the last row aligning to the left.

Here's a CSS example:

```css
.container {
  text-align: left;
}

.item {
  display: inline-block;
  width: auto; /* Width of the widest item */
  margin: 0 10px 10px 0; /* Adjust spacing as needed */
}
```

And the corresponding HTML:

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="item">Item 1</div>
  <div class="item">Item 2 with more content</div>
  <div class="item">Item 3</div>
  <!-- more items -->
</div>
```

This will make each `<div>` float left and begin a new line when the previous items fill up the width of the container. The width of each item will be based on the content, and you could set a `min-width` if you want a minimum size. If you need them all to have the same width as the widest item, you would have to set a fixed width based on that widest item or use JavaScript to determine the width dynamically. CSS alone cannot determine the width of the widest element and apply it to others automatically without a predefined width.
