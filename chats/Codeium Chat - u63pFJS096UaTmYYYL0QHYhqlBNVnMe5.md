Explain problem: `Type '(position: Position) => void' is not assignable to type '(context: CanvasRenderingContext2D, position: Position) => void'.
  Types of parameters 'position' and 'context' are incompatible.
    Type 'CanvasRenderingContext2D' is missing the following properties from type 'Position': leftX, topY`

The issue you're facing is that the `onReady` callback function you're assigning to `this.drawHero` is expecting a function with a parameter `(position: Position) => void`, but `this.drawHero` is defined as `(context: CanvasRenderingContext2D, position: Position) => void`. 

To resolve this, you need to update the signature of the `onReady` callback function in your `CharacterActionComponent` to accept both `CanvasRenderingContext2D` and `Position` parameters. 

Here's how you can update the `onReady` callback in your `CharacterActionComponent`:

```tsx
onReady={(draw: (context: CanvasRenderingContext2D, position: Position) => void) => {
  this.drawHero = draw;
}}
```

By updating the `onReady` callback signature to accept both `CanvasRenderingContext2D` and `Position` parameters, you align it with the expected signature for `this.drawHero`.

In my `CharacterActionComponent` I have:

```tsx
interface ICharacterActionComponentProps {
 onReady: (
  draw: (position: Position) => void,
  setFrameIndex: React.Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<number>>
 ) => void;
 baseCharacter: BaseCharacter;
 currentActionType: ActionType;
 position: { leftX: number; topY: number };
 onPositionChange: (newPosition: { leftX: number; topY: number }) => void;
};
```

The `onReady` definition does not expect a `context` parameter, as far as I can tell.

Based on the `ICharacterActionComponentProps` interface you provided, the `onReady` prop is indeed expecting a function that takes two parameters: `draw` which is a function that takes a `Position` object and `setFrameIndex` which is a React dispatch function for updating state.

The error message you're seeing suggests that somewhere in your code, likely where `this.drawHero` is being used, it is expected to be a function that takes two parameters: a `CanvasRenderingContext2D` and a `Position`. However, `this.drawHero` is being set to a function that only takes a `Position` based on the `onReady` prop's type.

To resolve the issue, you need to make sure that the `draw` function provided to `onReady` matches the expected usage of `this.drawHero`. This might involve updating the `onReady` prop type to include the `CanvasRenderingContext2D` parameter, or adjusting the code where `this.drawHero` is called to match the current `onReady` type.

If `this.drawHero` should indeed take a `CanvasRenderingContext2D` and a `Position`, you would need to update the `onReady` prop type accordingly:

```tsx
interface ICharacterActionComponentProps {
  onReady: (
    draw: (context: CanvasRenderingContext2D, position: Position) => void,
    setFrameIndex: React.Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<number>>
  ) => void;
  // ... other properties
}
```

And ensure that the `draw` function provided to `onReady` matches this signature. If you need further assistance, please provide the code where `this.drawHero` is called or defined.
