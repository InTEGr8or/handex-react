summary: The user asked how to get the container width in `App.tsx` in order to pass it down to `HandexTerm`. I provided a code snippet that demonstrates how to use a `ref` to the container element and then access its `clientWidth` property to determine the width. This width can then be passed down to `HandexTerm` as a prop. The code snippet includes setting up a `ref` for the container element, calculating the container width on initial render and window resize, and passing the width as a prop to `HandexTerm`.

Can I get the container width in `App.tsx` so that I can pass it down to `HandexTerm`?

Based on the provided information, `App.tsx` does not currently have access to the container's width directly. To pass the container width to `HandexTerm`, you would typically use a `ref` to the container element and then access its `clientWidth` property.

However, since `App.tsx` does not include container element details, I cannot give you a precise code snippet. If you have a container element around `<HandexTerm />` in `App.tsx`, you could add a `ref` to it and then pass the width down as a prop.

Here's a conceptual example:

```tsx
import React, { useRef, useState, useEffect } from 'react';
// ... other imports

const App = () => {
  const containerRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
  const [containerWidth, setContainerWidth] = useState<number>(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    setContainerWidth(containerRef.current?.clientWidth ?? 0);
  }, []);

  // Optionally, to handle window resizing:
  useEffect(() => {
    const handleResize = () => {
      setContainerWidth(containerRef.current?.clientWidth ?? 0);
    };

    window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
    return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
  }, []);

  return (
    <div ref={containerRef}>
      <HandexTerm terminalWidth={containerWidth} />
      {/* ... other components */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

This code assumes that `HandexTerm` accepts `terminalWidth` as a prop to specify its width. Please adjust the ref element type and prop names according to your actual implementation. If your `App.tsx` is different and you want a more fitting solution, please provide the structure of your `App.tsx` containing the container for `HandexTerm`.
