**User** _at 11:42 am, Jun 26, 2024_

I am using `amazon-cognito-identity-js` in my React TUI app.

I'm able to sign up and log in. I have created an IdentityPool associated with these users. 

Now I would like to make sure that I am storing my token safely and that I auto-refresh the token.

Can you help me do that?

```tsx
// src/lib/useAuth.ts

import { useState } from 'react';
import { CognitoUserPool, AuthenticationDetails, CognitoUser, CognitoUserAttribute, CognitoRefreshToken } from 'amazon-cognito-identity-js';

const poolData = {
 UserPoolId: 'us-east-1_apGvoR62E',
 ClientId: '776i4gt2nij7ce30m9jlo9fcq0'
};

const userPool = new CognitoUserPool(poolData);

export const useAuth = () => {
 const [isLoggedIn, setIsLoggedIn] = useState(false);

 const signUp = (username: string, password: string, email: string, callback: (error: any, result: any) => void) => {
  const attributeList = [
   new CognitoUserAttribute({

To securely store and auto-refresh tokens in your React TUI app using `amazon-cognito-identity-js`, you can follow these steps, leveraging the `useAuth` hook you've provided from `src/lib/useAuth.ts`. Your existing setup already handles sign-up, login, and the basics of token refreshing. Let's extend it to include secure token storage and automatic token refreshing.

### Securely Storing Tokens
For a web application, securely storing tokens typically involves using `sessionStorage` or `localStorage`. However, these storage mechanisms are vulnerable to XSS attacks. A more secure approach involves storing tokens in memory or using HttpOnly cookies, but these approaches have their limitations and complexities, especially in a TUI application that might not have a backend server to handle cookies.

Given the context, let's proceed with a sessionStorage solution for simplicity and demonstrate how you would extend it to include auto-refresh functionality.

1. **Storing Tokens After Login**:
   During the login process, after successfully receiving the tokens, store them in `sessionStorage`. Modify the `onSuccess` callback in the `login` function to include this step.

```tsx
onSuccess: (session) => {
  console.log('Authentication successful!', session.getIdToken().getJwtToken());
  setIsLoggedIn(true);
  // Store tokens in sessionStorage
  sessionStorage.setItem('idToken', session.getIdToken().getJwtToken());
  sessionStorage.setItem('accessToken', session.getAccessToken().getJwtToken());
  sessionStorage.setItem('refreshToken', session.getRefreshToken().getToken());
  ...
},
```

2. **Retrieving Stored Tokens**:
   You might want to retrieve these tokens for making authenticated requests to your backend or AWS services. You can create a helper function within `useAuth` or elsewhere in your application to fetch these tokens from `sessionStorage`.

### Auto-Refreshing Tokens
Your `refreshSession` method demonstrates the basic mechanism for refreshing tokens. To automate this process:

1. **Invoke `refreshSession` Automatically Before Token Expiry**:
   - You could use the `setTimeout` function to schedule the token refresh. This requires knowing the expiry time of the current token.
   - Upon successful login or token refresh, calculate the time until token expiry and set a timeout to automatically refresh the token before it expires.

```tsx
onSuccess: (session) => {
  ...
  // Assuming ID token has a 1 hour expiry, schedule a refresh for 55 minutes later
  const refreshTokenTimeout = (session.getIdToken().getExpiration() - Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) - 300) * 1000;
  setTimeout(refreshSession, refreshTokenTimeout);
  ...
},
```

2. **Refreshing Tokens on App Initialization**:
   - When your application initializes, you should check if a refresh token is available and whether the current tokens are expired or close to expiring. If so, attempt to refresh them immediately.
   - This could be done within the `useEffect` hook in your component that initializes the application state or directly in the `useAuth` hook.

### Handling Refresh Token Expiry
- Refresh tokens also have an expiry. If the refresh attempt fails due to an expired refresh token, you should prompt the user to log in again. Handle this within the `refreshSession` function's `onFailure` or error handling logic.

### Notes
- **Security Consideration**: Storing sensitive tokens in `sessionStorage` or `localStorage` can expose them to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Always ensure your application is secure against XSS by validating and sanitizing user inputs and only loading trusted content.
- **HttpOnly Cookies**: For applications that can leverage a backend, consider storing tokens in HttpOnly cookies set by the server. This method prevents JavaScript from accessing the tokens, mitigating the risk of XSS attacks.

Remember, the above approach is tailored to applications without a backend component handling authentication. Adjustments would be needed for applications with a server-side component.

You said "Security Consideration: Storing sensitive tokens in sessionStorage or localStorage can expose them to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks."

I am wondering, then, why you chose that as a method of storing the session tokens.

What are more secure options.

---

**Codeium** _at 11:50 am, Jun 26, 2024_

The choice to suggest `sessionStorage` or `localStorage` was primarily based on the context provided and the common practices within the constraints of client-side-only applications. However, given the security considerations, it's important to explore more secure alternatives for storing session tokens, especially for applications handling sensitive information.

### More Secure Options for Storing Session Tokens

#### 1. **HttpOnly Cookies**
Cookies marked as `HttpOnly` are inaccessible to JavaScript running in the browser, providing protection against XSS attacks. This method requires a backend server to set the `HttpOnly` cookie after authentication. When the user visits the application, their browser automatically sends the cookie along with each request to the server, which can validate the session's authenticity. This method is particularly effective for full-stack applications.

#### 2. **Token Handling on the Server Side**
A more secure approach involves keeping the session tokens entirely on the server side. In this scenario, the client application communicates with your backend, which in turn handles authentication with Cognito and stores the tokens securely. The server can issue its own session identifier (in an HttpOnly cookie or a custom header) to keep track of the session.

#### 3. **Secure, Short-Lived Tokens in Memory**
If you must store tokens on the client side without involving a backend, consider storing them in memory (e.g., within a JavaScript variable or using a state management library). While this approach protects against XSS attacks, the tokens are lost if the user refreshes the page. To mitigate this, you could use short-lived tokens and implement silent authentication or refresh mechanisms to renew the tokens as needed without interrupting the user experience.

#### 4. **Refresh Tokens with Secure Policies**
If using refresh tokens on the client side, ensure they're short-lived and have strict usage policies. For example, limit the number of times a refresh token can be used or require additional authentication factors to refresh sessions. This limits the window of opportunity for an attacker if they manage to obtain a refresh token.

#### 5. **Encrypted Storage Solutions**
Though not immune to XSS, encrypting tokens before storing them in `sessionStorage` or `localStorage` adds an additional layer of security. Encryption keys can be kept in memory, reducing (but not eliminating) the risk of token exposure. Encrypted storage won't protect against XSS directly but ensures that captured tokens cannot be used by an attacker without also obtaining the encryption key.

#### 6. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**
Implementing a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) helps mitigate the risk of XSS attacks by controlling the resources the browser is allowed to load for your site. While CSP is not a method of storing tokens, it is a critical security measure that can protect token storage from being compromised.

### Conclusion
Choosing the right method for storing session tokens involves balancing security requirements, user experience, and application architecture. For applications with a backend, leveraging `HttpOnly` cookies and handling tokens server-side is generally the most secure approach. For client-side-only applications, storing tokens in memory, using secure, short-lived tokens, and implementing CSP can help mitigate risks.

Would using a passkey simplify anything or solve any of these problems?

---

**Codeium** _at 6:41 pm, Jun 26, 2024_

Passkeys represent a newer approach in the authentication landscape, aimed at enhancing security and user experience by eliminating traditional passwords. They are part of the Web Authentication API (WebAuthn) specification and leverage public key cryptography to authenticate users. A user registers a device with the service (your application), and the device creates a pair of cryptographic keys: a private key stored securely on the user's device and a public key shared with the service. During authentication, the service challenges the device, which responds with a signature proving possession of the private key without ever sharing it.

### How Passkeys Could Affect Token Storage and Security

#### Simplification and Security Enhancements

1. **Reduced Reliance on Tokens for Authentication**: With passkeys, authentication relies on cryptographic proof of identity, potentially reducing the need for storing and managing session tokens on the client side. This could simplify the authentication flow and enhance security by minimizing exposure to token theft.

2. **Elimination of Passwords**: By removing passwords, passkeys inherently reduce the risk associated with password theft, reuse, and phishing attacks. This shift could simplify user management and the authentication infrastructure, as the complexities of password policies, storage, and resets are eliminated.

3. **Enhanced User Experience**: Passkeys can streamline the user experience, especially on devices with biometric capabilities (e.g., fingerprint or facial recognition). Users can authenticate seamlessly without needing to remember passwords or manually refresh tokens.

#### Considerations for Session Management

1. **Session Tokens Still Required**: While passkeys can authenticate a user, applications typically still need to manage sessions—especially for web applications. This means issuing a token (such as a JWT) upon successful authentication to manage the user's session state and access permissions. The considerations around secure token storage and refresh mechanisms remain relevant.

2. **Compatibility and Adoption**: The effectiveness of passkeys depends on user devices and browsers supporting the WebAuthn API. While support is growing, not all users may have compatible devices or browsers, making it necessary to maintain fallback authentication methods for the foreseeable future.

3. **Backend Support**: Implementing passkeys requires support on the backend to handle the registration and authentication flows according to the WebAuthn specification. This includes generating and verifying cryptographic challenges, storing public keys, and managing device registrations securely.

### Conclusion

Passkeys introduce a promising direction for simplifying authentication and enhancing security by leveraging cryptographic keys instead of traditional passwords. They can reduce some of the security concerns associated with token-based authentication by securing the initial authentication step. However, applications still need to manage session tokens securely, and considerations around token storage, refresh mechanisms, and security best practices remain important.

As the ecosystem around passkeys and WebAuthn matures, adopting these technologies could significantly impact how developers approach authentication and session management, offering a more secure and user-friendly alternative to traditional methods.

In my Edge Developer tools Application tab, I can see a "Private state tokens" item. Is that any kind of secure token storage?

---

**Codeium** _at 6:49 pm, Jun 26, 2024_

As of my last update, Microsoft Edge (and other Chromium-based browsers) introduced a feature called "Partitioned Cookies" or "State Partitions" as part of their efforts to enhance privacy and security. This feature is designed to mitigate cross-site tracking by partitioning cookies and other site data (including localStorage, sessionStorage, IndexedDB, etc.) based on the top-level site the user is interacting with. However, the term "Private state tokens" specifically does not refer to a commonly recognized standard feature or technology for storing tokens securely in web browsers. It's possible that "Private state tokens" could be related to a specific implementation detail in Microsoft Edge or an experimental feature.

### Understanding Secure Token Storage in the Context of Web Browsers:

#### 1. **Web Cryptography API:**
For secure token storage, developers often rely on the Web Cryptography API to encrypt tokens before storing them in less secure storage options like `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`. This API provides cryptographic operations in web applications, including hashing, signature generation, and encryption.

#### 2. **HttpOnly Cookies:**
The most recommended way to securely store tokens, especially session tokens, is by using HttpOnly cookies. These cookies are inaccessible to JavaScript and are automatically managed by the browser, significantly reducing the risk of XSS attacks.

#### 3. **Browser Storage Mechanisms:**
- **localStorage and sessionStorage:** Not secure for sensitive data on their own as they're accessible to any JavaScript running on the page, making them vulnerable to XSS attacks.
- **IndexedDB:** More complex, can store larger amounts of data, but shares the same security concerns as localStorage and sessionStorage.

#### 4. **Partitioned Storage:**
The concept of partitioning, such as in Chromium's "Partitioned Cookies," aims to isolate data storage (including cookies) on a per-site basis to prevent tracking across sites but is not specifically designed for enhancing the security of token storage against threats like XSS.

### Key Takeaways:

- **"Private state tokens" in Edge Developer Tools** might be related to an internal feature or an experimental setting aimed at privacy or state management, rather than a secure storage mechanism specifically designed for authentication tokens.
- For secure token storage, relying on HttpOnly cookies, encryption via the Web Cryptography API, or backend mechanisms is advisable.
- Always stay updated on browser features and best practices for web security, as these areas evolve rapidly.

If "Private State Tokens" is a new or emerging feature, I recommend consulting the official Microsoft Edge documentation or web development forums for the latest information and guidance on how it can be utilized for secure token storage or what its intended use case might be.

**User** _at 6:52 pm, Jun 26, 2024_

How can I use Web Criptography API to store my tokens? Will it work in a browser-side application? Or would it be better to use HttpOnly cookies, and if so how would I do that?

---

**Codeium** _at 6:53 pm, Jun 26, 2024_

Using the Web Cryptography API to encrypt tokens before storing them in the browser (e.g., in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`) can add a layer of security by ensuring that even if an attacker can access the storage, they cannot decrypt the tokens without the key. However, this method should not be considered foolproof, especially for highly sensitive data, because the key management becomes a critical challenge. If the key is also stored on the client side, an attacker who gains access to the storage could potentially decrypt the tokens.

### Using Web Cryptography API for Token Encryption

1. **Generate a Key**: First, you need to generate a cryptographic key that can be used for encryption and decryption.

```javascript
let key;

window.crypto.subtle.generateKey(
  {
    name: "AES-GCM",
    length: 256,
  },
  true,
  ["encrypt", "decrypt"]
)
.then((generatedKey) => {
  key = generatedKey;
});
```

2. **Encrypt the Token**: Before storing the token, encrypt it using the generated key.

```javascript
function encryptData(secretData, key) {
  const encodedData = new TextEncoder().encode(secretData);
  return window.crypto.subtle.encrypt(
    {
      name: "AES-GCM",
      iv: window.crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(12)), // Initialization vector.
    },
    key,
    encodedData
  );
}
```

3. **Decrypt the Token**: When you need to use the token, decrypt it with the key.

```javascript
function decryptData(encryptedData, key) {
  return window.crypto.subtle.decrypt(
    {
      name: "AES-GCM",
      iv: encryptedData.iv, // The same IV must be used for decryption.
    },
    key,
    encryptedData
  )
  .then((decryptedBuffer) => {
    const decodedData = new TextDecoder().decode(decryptedBuffer);
    return decodedData;
  });
}
```

### Key Management Challenge

- The main challenge with encryption in a client-side application is securely managing the encryption key. If an attacker can access the key, they can decrypt the data.
- One approach is to derive the key from a user's password at login and not store the key. However, this means the user must provide their password each time they access the encrypted data.

### Using HttpOnly Cookies

For a more secure approach, especially for session management, using `HttpOnly` cookies set by a server is recommended.

1. **Set HttpOnly Cookie from Server**: When a user logs in, your server should authenticate the user and then set an HttpOnly cookie containing the session token.

```http
Set-Cookie: session_token="your_secure_token"; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Strict;
```

2. **Browser Sends Cookie Automatically**: The browser automatically sends the cookie with each subsequent request to your server, but JavaScript cannot access it, mitigating the risk of XSS attacks.

3. **Server Validates Session Token**: On receiving a request, your server should validate the session token from the cookie to authenticate the user.

### Conclusion

- For storing tokens on the client side, encryption with the Web Cryptography API can add a layer of security but has limitations, especially regarding key management.
- Using `HttpOnly` cookies is a more secure option for session tokens as it prevents JavaScript access to the cookies, reducing the risk of XSS attacks. This method requires a backend server to set and manage the cookies.
- The choice between these methods depends on your application's architecture and the sensitivity of the data you're protecting.

Does AWS Cognito not use HttpOnly cookies? Wouldn't I be able to do that through Cognito config?

---

**Codeium** _at 6:57 pm, Jun 26, 2024_

As of my last update, AWS Cognito primarily focuses on token-based authentication methods using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), including ID tokens, access tokens, and refresh tokens. This approach is well-suited for serverless and decentralized architectures, including web applications, mobile apps, and single-page applications (SPAs) that interact with APIs.

### Cognito and HttpOnly Cookies:
- **Direct Support**: AWS Cognito does not automatically manage `HttpOnly` cookies for session management in the client's browser. Instead, it provides JWTs that the client application is responsible for handling. This means that if you want to use `HttpOnly` cookies with Cognito, you would need to implement an intermediate layer—typically, a server or a serverless function (like AWS Lambda behind API Gateway) that handles the tokens.
- **Custom Implementation for HttpOnly Cookies**: To securely use Cognito with `HttpOnly` cookies, you can create a backend service that authenticates with Cognito, then sets an `HttpOnly` cookie with a session identifier or token for the client. Here's a simplified flow:
    1. **User Login**: The user logs in through your client-side application, which sends the credentials to your backend.
    2. **Backend Authentication with Cognito**: Your backend uses the AWS SDK to authenticate the user with Cognito and receives the JWTs.
    3. **Set HttpOnly Cookie**: Instead of sending these tokens directly back to the client, your backend creates a session for the user and stores the tokens securely on the server side. It then sends back an `HttpOnly` cookie to the client with the session identifier.
    4. **Client-Server Communication**: The client automatically sends the `HttpOnly` cookie with each request to your backend, which uses the session identifier to retrieve the user’s tokens and interact with Cognito or other services as needed.
    5. **Logout and Session Expiry Management**: Your backend provides endpoints to manage logout and check session validity, handling the Cognito tokens as required.

### Advantages of Using HttpOnly Cookies:
- **Security**: `HttpOnly` cookies are not accessible via JavaScript, reducing the risk of XSS attacks.
- **Simplicity for Clients**: The client application doesn’t need to manage token storage or renewal, which simplifies the authentication flow.

### Considerations:
- **Implementation Effort**: Requires additional backend infrastructure to handle the authentication flow and session management.
- **Cross-Origin Requests**: You need to manage CORS and ensure that your client application can securely communicate with your backend.
- **Scalability and Management**: You're responsible for managing session state, which might require additional considerations for scalability and persistence.

### Conclusion:
While AWS Cognito itself does not directly manage `HttpOnly` cookies for client-side session management, you can achieve a secure and scalable authentication mechanism using Cognito by implementing an intermediate backend service that handles the authentication flow, sets `HttpOnly` cookies, and manages session state. This approach combines the robust authentication and user management features of Cognito with the security benefits of `HttpOnly` cookies.

**User** _at 7:21 pm, Jun 26, 2024_

I am looking at AWS docs that suggest using a Lambda function and an API Gateway to implement HttpOnly Cookies. That's not terrible, but I want to think about if that is the right solution for this case.

I will be wanting to send some data I'm storing in `localStorage` to S3, to a folder prefixed by the Cognito user id, so that I can isolate each users content.

Does AWS Amplify provide secure token storage on the client side?

---

**Codeium** _at 7:21 pm, Jun 26, 2024_

AWS Amplify provides an integrated solution to work with AWS services, including Cognito for authentication and S3 for storage. While it simplifies interactions with Cognito and other AWS services, the way it manages tokens on the client side, particularly regarding secure storage, is built around the standard practices for web and mobile applications. Amplify abstracts away the direct handling of tokens but does not inherently change the security properties of the client-side environment.

### Amplify and Token Storage:
- **Local Storage**: By default, when using Amplify with Cognito, the authentication tokens (ID token, access token, and refresh token) are stored in the browser's local storage or the mobile app's equivalent secure storage. This approach enables easy access to tokens for making authenticated requests to AWS services.
- **Security Consideration**: While local storage is convenient, it's accessible via JavaScript, making it vulnerable to XSS attacks. Amplify does not automatically store tokens in `HttpOnly` cookies because it operates primarily on the client side, where direct access to `HttpOnly` cookies is not possible.

### Using AWS Amplify with HttpOnly Cookies:
To leverage `HttpOnly` cookies in a project that uses AWS Amplify, you would need an intermediary, such as a server or serverless function (AWS Lambda behind Amazon API Gateway), similar to the approach discussed earlier. This intermediary would handle the authentication with Cognito, store the tokens securely, and set an `HttpOnly` cookie with a session identifier for the client.

### AWS Amplify for S3 Uploads with User Isolation:
For uploading data to S3 with isolation based on the Cognito user ID, AWS Amplify simplifies this process. You can use the `Auth` module to obtain the current authenticated user's information, including the user ID, and the `Storage` module to upload data to S3. Here's a simplified example:

```javascript
import { Auth, Storage } from 'aws-amplify';

async function uploadFile(file) {
  const currentUser = await Auth.currentAuthenticatedUser();
  const userId = currentUser.attributes.sub; // The Cognito user ID
  const key = `${userId}/your_file_name`;

  try {
    await Storage.put(key, file, {
      level: 'protected', // Ensures that only the uploading user has access
    });
    console.log('Upload successful');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Upload error', error);
  }
}
```

This approach takes advantage of Amplify's client-side capabilities for authentication and storage, using the user's Cognito ID to prefix the S3 object keys for user data isolation.

### Conclusion:
While AWS Amplify provides convenient client-side integration with AWS services, including secure token management by abstracting direct token handling, it does not inherently provide a mechanism for `HttpOnly` cookie storage of tokens, as this would require server-side support. For applications needing the heightened security of `HttpOnly` cookies for token storage, integrating a backend layer to manage authentication tokens is necessary. Amplify can still be used effectively for its simplified access to AWS services like Cognito and S3, especially when implementing user data isolation and secure access patterns.
