I need your help setting the `zombie4` current action to `Attack` when he is near the Hero.

To set the `zombie4` current action to `Attack` when near the Hero, you will need to determine the distance between the `zombie4` and the Hero, and then update the action accordingly. You can do this within your game loop or a specific update function that checks for proximity.

Here is a conceptual approach based on the context provided:

1. Calculate the distance between `zombie4` and the Hero.
2. If the distance is within a certain threshold, set the `zombie4` action to `Attack`.
3. Update the `zombie4` action state and ensure the animation reflects the change.

You could add a method to `TerminalGame` to check for proximity and update actions:

```tsx
checkProximityAndSetAction() {
  // Constants to define "near"
  const ATTACK_THRESHOLD = 50; // pixels or appropriate unit for your game

  if (!this.hero || !this.zombie4) return;

  // Calculate the distance between the hero and zombie4
  const distance = Math.abs(this.state.heroPosition.leftX - this.state.zombie4Position.leftX);

  // If zombie4 is near the Hero, set its current action to Attack
  if (distance < ATTACK_THRESHOLD) {
    // Assuming zombie4 has a method to update its action
    this.zombie4.setCurrentActionType('Attack'); // Replace 'Attack' with actual ActionType for attacking
  } else {
    // Otherwise, set it back to whatever action it should be doing when not attacking
    this.zombie4.setCurrentActionType('Walk'); // Replace 'Walk' with actual ActionType for walking
  }

  // Update the state or force a re-render if necessary, depending on how your animation loop is set up
  // this.setState({ ... }); or this.forceUpdate();
}
```

You would call this method within your game loop, for example within `updateCharacterAndBackground` or any similar function that runs every frame or tick.

Please ensure that `setCurrentActionType` is a method available on your `zombie4` object and that it correctly updates the action and triggers the necessary changes in animation. If this method does not exist, you will need to implement it accordingly.

Keep in mind to replace `'Attack'` and `'Walk'` with the actual `ActionType` enum values you have defined in your `BaseCharacter` or related classes.
