**User** _at 9:33 am, Jun 26, 2024_

I am trying to use AWS Amplify v2 for Cognito authentication and token storage and refresh.

I think I am using some old syntax or something here:

```tsx
// src/lib/Amplify.ts

import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';

Amplify.configure({
  Auth: {

    // OPTIONAL - Amazon Cognito User Pool ID
    userPoolId: 'us-east-1_apGvoR62E',

    // OPTIONAL - Amazon Cognito Web Client ID (26-char alphanumeric string)
    userPoolWebClientId: '776i4gt2nij7ce30m9jlo9fcq0',
     
    // OPTIONAL - Enforce user authentication prior to accessing AWS resources or not
    mandatorySignIn: true,
     
    // OPTIONAL - Configuration for cookie storage
    // Note: if the secure flag is set to true, then the cookie transmission requires a secure protocol
    cookieStorage: {
      // REQUIRED - Cookie domain (only required if cookieStorage is provided)
        domain: '.handterm.com',
      // OPTIONAL - Cookie path
        path: '/',
      // OPTIONAL - Cookie expiration in days
        expires: 365,
      // OPTIONAL - Cookie secure flag
      // Either true or false, indicating if the cookie transmission requires a secure protocol (https).
        secure: true
    },

    // OPTIONAL - customized storage object
     
    // OPTIONAL - Manually set the authentication flow type. Default is 'USER_SRP_AUTH'
    authenticationFlowType: 'USER_PASSWORD_AUTH'
  }
});
```

And it's not working.

It has the right values, but the syntax is not right and I don't see an example in the Amplify v2 docs.

In AWS Amplify version 2 for handling Cognito authentication and token storage, the configuration syntax you've provided is generally correct for version 3 and earlier. However, if you're facing issues, it might be due to other reasons rather than the syntax itself, assuming you are using a version where this syntax is supported. AWS Amplify's configuration hasn't drastically changed in terms of how you specify Cognito settings between versions. 

Here are a few things you should check or try to troubleshoot your issue:

1. **Version Check**: Ensure you have the correct version of AWS Amplify installed that supports the configuration syntax you are using. You can check your `package.json` to see the installed version. Amplify has been updated over time, but the configuration for Cognito has remained relatively stable.

2. **Initialization**: Make sure this configuration code in `src/lib/Amplify.ts` is executed before you use any of the Amplify Auth methods. This is typically done by importing this configuration file in your app's entry point, like `index.tsx` or `App.tsx`, to ensure it runs at the startup of your application.

   ```tsx
   // In your index.tsx or App.tsx
   import './lib/Amplify';
   ```

3. **Check for Errors**: If the configuration is not being applied or you're facing specific issues with authentication, check the browser console for errors. Sometimes, the issue might be related to network requests being blocked or incorrect setup in the AWS Cognito Console.

4. **Verify Cognito Setup**: Ensure your User Pool ID and Web Client ID are correct and that the User Pool is configured to allow the authentication flow type you've specified (`USER_PASSWORD_AUTH`).

5. **Amplify Documentation**: Although you mentioned difficulty finding relevant examples in the Amplify v2 docs, the AWS Amplify Documentation is regularly updated. If you're using a feature or syntax from an older version, consider checking both the latest docs and version-specific guides or migration paths provided by AWS.

6. **Fallback to Default Auth Flow**: If you're not specifically required to use `USER_PASSWORD_AUTH`, you might want to try the default `USER_SRP_AUTH` to see if issues persist. This can help isolate the problem to the authentication flow type.

7. **Dependencies**: Ensure all related dependencies are up to date and compatible with each other. Sometimes, issues can arise from mismatched versions of Amplify modules.

If after these checks you're still facing issues, you might want to provide more details on the exact error message or behavior you're encountering. There could be more specific guidance available once the nature of the problem is clearer.

**User** _at 9:35 am, Jun 26, 2024_

I'm sorry. When I said v2 I meant gen 2. That's what the Amplify online docs call it.

These are the versions in my `package.json`

```json
  "aws-amplify": "^6.3.8",
  "@aws-amplify/auth": "^6.3.7",
```

**Codeium** _at 9:36 am, Jun 26, 2024_

Given that you're using AWS Amplify version 6.3.8 for `aws-amplify` and 6.3.7 for `@aws-amplify/auth`, you're indeed working with what's referred to as Amplify Library Gen 2. This generation focuses on modular imports to optimize bundle sizes among other improvements.

For Gen 2, the approach to configuring Amplify, especially for authentication with Amazon Cognito, remains similar but leans towards using modular imports for efficiency. Assuming you're facing issues with the configuration not being recognized or working as expected, here's a revised approach based on the versions you're using:

1. **Ensure Modular Imports**: Since you're using Gen 2, make sure you're importing only what you need. It looks like you're already doing this with `@aws-amplify/auth`.

2. **Configuration Syntax Check**: The configuration syntax you've shared should technically work with Gen 2 as well, as there haven't been breaking changes in the configuration API. However, always ensure that the configuration is done early in your application's lifecycle (e.g., in your entry file or before you use any Auth methods).

3. **Example Configuration with Gen 2 Syntax**:

Here is how you might correctly import and configure Amplify Auth with Gen 2 syntax:

```tsx
// src/lib/AmplifyConfig.ts
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
import { Auth } from '@aws-amplify/auth';

// Configure Amplify with Auth module
Amplify.configure({
  Auth: {
    userPoolId: 'us-east-1_apGvoR62E',
    userPoolWebClientId: '776i4gt2nij7ce30m9jlo9fcq0',
    mandatorySignIn: true,
    cookieStorage: {
      domain: '.handterm.com',
      path: '/',
      expires: 365,
      secure: true
    },
    authenticationFlowType: 'USER_PASSWORD_AUTH'
  }
});

// Explicitly configure the Auth module
Auth.configure(Amplify.configure());
```

4. **Import the Configuration**: Make sure to import your configuration file at the root of your application (e.g., in `index.tsx` or `App.tsx`) to ensure it's executed before any Auth operations are performed.

```tsx
// src/index.tsx or App.tsx
import './lib/AmplifyConfig';
// ... rest of your app's imports and code
```

5. **Debugging**: If issues persist:
   - Double-check that your Cognito User Pool and App Client settings in the AWS Console align with the authentication flow type and other parameters you've set.
   - Look out for errors in the console related to the configuration or authentication process, which can give clues about what might be going wrong.
   - Ensure there are no network issues or incorrect CORS settings that might be blocking requests to Cognito.

6. **Documentation and Support**: For any discrepancies with the documentation or if the problem seems to be with the library itself, consider reaching out to AWS Support or checking the AWS Amplify GitHub issues for similar problems reported by other users.

By following these steps and ensuring everything is correctly set up, you should be able to use AWS Amplify Gen 2 for Cognito authentication successfully.

I get the error `Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'userPoolId' does not exist in type 'AuthConfig'.ts(2353)` when I use the above code.

Keep in mind that this app is a client-side app with all the code running in the browser. I have been able to authenticate with `amazon-cognito-identity-js`, but in a previous conversation you recommended that I upgrade to AWS Amplify.

**Codeium** _at 10:01 am, Jun 26, 2024_

If you're encountering an error stating that `'userPoolId' does not exist in type 'AuthConfig'` when using AWS Amplify Gen 2 (`aws-amplify` version 6.x and `@aws-amplify/auth` version 6.x), it indicates that there might be a mismatch in how the configuration object is being recognized by TypeScript. This can happen due to changes or updates in the library's TypeScript definitions.

AWS Amplify Gen 2 introduced a more modular approach, and with it, some changes to how services are configured. Given that you are working in a TypeScript environment and focusing on client-side authentication, you should ensure that your configuration aligns with the expected types.

Here’s a revised approach considering the error and the fact that you are using AWS Amplify primarily for Amazon Cognito authentication in a browser environment:

1. **Ensure Correct Import and Configuration**: With AWS Amplify Gen 2, configurations for specific services like Auth should be done using the service-specific import. Since you're seeing an issue with the `AuthConfig` type, let's ensure that we're importing and configuring `Auth` correctly.

2. **Modular Import and Configuration**: Given the error, it's crucial to align with the expected `AuthConfig` type which might have been updated in Gen 2. 

Here's how you can adjust your configuration:

```typescript
// src/lib/AmplifyConfig.ts
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
import { Auth } from '@aws-amplify/auth';

Auth.configure({
    identityPoolId: 'us-east-1:xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx', // If you are using Federated Identities
    region: 'us-east-1', // Your Cognito User Pool region
    userPoolId: 'us-east-1_apGvoR62E',
    userPoolWebClientId: '776i4gt2nij7ce30m9jlo9fcq0',
    mandatorySignIn: true,
    cookieStorage: {
      domain: '.handterm.com',
      path: '/',
      expires: 365,
      secure: true
    },
    authenticationFlowType: 'USER_PASSWORD_AUTH'
});

Amplify.register(Auth);
```

In this configuration:
- We're directly configuring the `Auth` module with its specific settings.
- The `Amplify.register(Auth);` line is crucial as it ensures that the `Auth` module is correctly registered with the Amplify library, making it aware of the Auth configuration.

3. **Review TypeScript Definitions**: If TypeScript still flags the configuration object, ensure your `@types/aws-amplify` or similar type definitions are up to date. Sometimes, type definitions may lag behind library updates or may not perfectly reflect the library's current state.

4. **Consult Documentation for Breaking Changes**: Since AWS Amplify Gen 2 represents a significant shift towards modular imports and usage, review the [AWS Amplify Documentation](https://docs.amplify.aws/) for any breaking changes or migration guides that relate to authentication configuration.

5. **Fallback to Direct `amazon-cognito-identity-js` Use**: If the primary goal is to integrate Amazon Cognito and you encounter persistent issues with Amplify's Auth module, continuing to use `amazon-cognito-identity-js` directly is a valid approach, especially if it's already working for your use case. However, using Amplify provides additional benefits like easier integration with other AWS services, improved abstraction, and features, so resolving the configuration issue is worthwhile if you plan to leverage these benefits.

Remember, when working with AWS Amplify and TypeScript, keeping all related packages and type definitions up to date is crucial to avoid type mismatches and leverage the latest features and fixes.

That gives me this error: `Module '"@aws-amplify/auth"' has no exported member 'Auth'.ts(2305)`

---

**Codeium** _at 10:11 am, Jun 26, 2024_

Given the error message you're encountering, it seems there's been a confusion with the import statement from `@aws-amplify/auth`. Starting with AWS Amplify version 3, which introduced the modular import system, and continuing into what is informally known as "Gen 2" of the Amplify library (versions 6.x.x and above), the approach to importing specific Amplify services like Auth has been standardized but might vary slightly from the examples or usage patterns you might be familiar with from earlier versions.

The error `Module '"@aws-amplify/auth"' has no exported member 'Auth'.ts(2305)` suggests that the import statement for `Auth` is incorrect based on the library's current structure. In the newer versions of Amplify, you should directly import the `Auth` class without destructuring it from the module. Here's how to do it correctly:

```typescript
// Correctly importing Auth from @aws-amplify/auth in Amplify v6.x.x
import Auth from '@aws-amplify/auth';
```

After correcting the import, you configure `Auth` similarly to how you've done before, but it's important to ensure compatibility with the modular import system. Here's an example that reflects this correction:

```typescript
import Amplify from 'aws-amplify';
import Auth from '@aws-amplify/auth';

Auth.configure({
  // Your Auth configuration here
  region: 'us-east-1',
  userPoolId: 'us-east-1_apGvoR62E',
  userPoolWebClientId: '776i4gt2nij7ce30m9jlo9fcq0',
  mandatorySignIn: true,
  authenticationFlowType: 'USER_PASSWORD_AUTH',
  cookieStorage: {
    domain: '.handterm.com',
    path: '/',
    expires: 365,
    secure: true
  },
});

// If you're using other AWS services, you can similarly import and configure them here
// Example: import API from '@aws-amplify/api';
// API.configure({ ... });
```

Make sure that this configuration is executed early in your application's lifecycle, typically in your entry file (such as `index.tsx` or `App.tsx`), to ensure that the `Auth` module is correctly configured before you attempt to use it anywhere in your app.

If you're only using the Auth module from Amplify and wish to keep your bundle size optimized, this approach ensures you import only what you need. However, if you plan to use additional services from AWS Amplify later on, remember to import and configure those services in a similar manner.

Given the error you're encountering, it seems there's a misunderstanding in how the `Auth` module is configured with the newer AWS Amplify versions. The error message indicates that TypeScript can't find a `configure` method on the `Auth` module, which suggests a potential issue with how the configuration is being applied, especially considering the modular approach introduced in newer versions of Amplify.

For AWS Amplify versions 6.x and above, the correct way to configure the `Auth` module should align with the modular import system and the way Amplify expects configurations to be defined. However, your setup and error messages suggest there's a conflict or an incorrect approach being used.

Given the issues you've faced, let's try a slightly different approach to ensure we're using the `Auth` module correctly:

1. **Direct Configuration with Amplify**: Instead of trying to configure the `Auth` module directly, you configure it through the Amplify main object. This is a common approach for initializing Amplify modules, including Auth.

2. **Ensure Correct Module Versions**: Double-check that your `@aws-amplify/auth` and `aws-amplify` packages are up to date and compatible. Mismatched versions can sometimes cause unexpected issues.

3. **Amplify Configuration Example**: Here's how you might configure Amplify with the Auth module, taking into account the need to use a centralized Amplify configuration:

```typescript
import Amplify from 'aws-amplify';

// Directly using the configuration object with Amplify
Amplify.configure({
  Auth: {
    region: 'us-east-1',
    userPoolId: 'us-east-1_apGvoR62E',
    userPoolWebClientId: '776i4gt2nij7ce30m9jlo9fcq0',
    mandatorySignIn: true,
    authenticationFlowType: 'USER_PASSWORD_AUTH',
    cookieStorage: {
      domain: '.handterm.com',
      path: '/',
      expires: 365,
      secure: true
    },
    // Additional configuration settings as needed
  }
});
```

This approach uses the Amplify object to configure the Auth module, which should align with how Amplify's configuration system is designed to work, especially in newer versions.

4. **Import and Configuration Execution**: Ensure that this configuration is placed in a central part of your application (such as the entry file) where it's executed before any authentication operations are attempted. This setup ensures that the Auth module is properly configured with your specified settings from the start.

5. **Review and Testing**: After applying this configuration, thoroughly test your authentication flow to ensure that the configuration changes have taken effect and that you're able to use the Auth module as expected.

If this approach still results in issues, I recommend reviewing the official AWS Amplify documentation for the latest guidance on configuring the Auth module, as there might be version-specific changes or additional setup steps that are not covered in this response.

Based on the error message you've provided, it seems there's a persistent issue with TypeScript recognizing the `configure` method on the Amplify object, which is quite unusual considering `Amplify.configure()` is a standard method for setting up AWS Amplify.

Given this context, let's try to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

### 1. Verify Amplify Installation

First, ensure that AWS Amplify is correctly installed in your project. Given the versions you've mentioned (`aws-amplify` version ^6.3.8 and `@aws-amplify/auth` version ^6.3.7), the installation should support the configuration method.

If there's any doubt, you can reinstall or update the packages:

```bash
npm install aws-amplify@latest @aws-amplify/auth@latest
```
or if you're using Yarn:

```bash
yarn add aws-amplify@latest @aws-amplify/auth@latest
```

### 2. Simplify and Isolate Configuration

To isolate the issue, try simplifying your configuration to the bare minimum, focusing only on the `Auth` module:

```typescript
import Amplify from 'aws-amplify';

Amplify.configure({
  Auth: {
    region: "us-east-1",
    userPoolId: "us-east-1_apGvoR62E",
    userPoolWebClientId: "776i4gt2nij7ce30m9jlo9fcq0",
  },
});
```

Place this in a central part of your application, such as the entry point (`index.tsx` for React projects).

### 3. TypeScript and Amplify Compatibility

Ensure that your TypeScript version is compatible with the AWS Amplify library versions you're using. Sometimes, newer TypeScript versions introduce stricter type checking that might cause issues with libraries not yet updated to match.

You can check your TypeScript version with:

```bash
npx tsc --version
```

And if necessary, adjust your TypeScript version to a slightly older version that's known to work well with AWS Amplify:

```bash
npm install typescript@version --save-dev
```

Replace `version` with a specific version number, such as `4.1.2`.

### 4. Check for Custom TypeScript Configuration

If you have a `tsconfig.json` in your project, review it to ensure there are no overly strict settings that might be causing this issue. Specifically, look for and adjust or remove settings like `noImplicitAny`, `strict`, or `strictPropertyInitialization` temporarily to see if that resolves the issue.

### 5. Consult Documentation and Community

If the issue persists, consult the [AWS Amplify Documentation](https://docs.amplify.aws/) and community forums or GitHub issues. It's possible others have encountered similar issues, especially with newer versions of the library or TypeScript.

Given the information provided, these steps represent a comprehensive approach to troubleshooting the problem. If after trying these steps the issue remains unresolved, please provide additional context or consider reaching out to AWS support or the AWS Amplify GitHub repository for more targeted assistance.

I see this in the Amplify Gen 1 documentation:

```ts
Amplify.configure({
  Auth: {
    Cognito: {
      userPoolClientId: 'abcdefghij1234567890',
      userPoolId: 'us-east-1_abcd1234',
      loginWith: { // Optional
        oauth: {
          domain: 'abcdefghij1234567890-29051e27.auth.us-east-1.amazoncognito.com',
          scopes: ['openid','email','phone','profile','aws.cognito.signin.user.admin'],
          redirectSignIn: ['http://localhost:3000/','https://example.com/'],
          redirectSignOut: ['http://localhost:3000/','https://example.com/'],
          responseType: 'code',
        }
        username: 'true',
        email: 'false', // Optional
        phone: 'false', // Optional
      }
    }
  }
});
```

But we are using Gen 2 in this application, as I mentioned before.

---

**Codeium** _at 10:18 am, Jun 26, 2024_

Given the information and the confusion around configuring AWS Amplify Gen 2 (which refers to the modular import system introduced in Amplify version 3 and later versions, including your setup with version 6.x), let's clarify how you should approach this configuration while considering the Gen 1 example you've provided.

For AWS Amplify Gen 2 with the versions you're using (`"aws-amplify": "^6.3.8"`, `"@aws-amplify/auth": "^6.3.7"`), the configuration should not nest `Auth` under `Cognito`, as shown in the Gen 1 example. Instead, you directly use the `Auth` parameters as top-level keys within the `Auth` configuration object. The Gen 2 (modular) approach simplifies importing and using Amplify services, focusing on reducing bundle sizes and improving tree shaking.

Here's how you should structure your `Amplify.configure()` call for the Auth module, taking into account the correct format for the Gen 2 configuration:

```typescript
import Amplify from 'aws-amplify';
import '@aws-amplify/auth';

Amplify.configure({
  Auth: {
    region: 'us-east-1', // Your Cognito User Pool region
    userPoolId: 'us-east-1_abcd1234', // Your Cognito User Pool ID
    userPoolWebClientId: 'abcdefghij1234567890', // Your Cognito App Client ID
    mandatorySignIn: true,
    cookieStorage: {
      domain: '.yourdomain.com',
      path: '/',
      expires: 365,
      secure: true
    },
    // OAuth configuration (if needed)
    oauth: {
      domain: 'abcdefghij1234567890-29051e27.auth.us-east-1.amazoncognito.com',
      scopes: ['openid', 'email', 'phone', 'profile', 'aws.cognito.signin.user.admin'],
      redirectSignIn: 'http://localhost:3000/', // Or your custom sign-in page URL
      redirectSignOut: 'http://localhost:3000/', // Or your custom sign-out page URL
      responseType: 'code' // or 'token', depending on your flow
    }
  }
});
```

Ensure that your configuration matches the structure above, with direct properties under `Auth` rather than nesting under `Cognito`. This structure is aligned with AWS Amplify Gen 2's approach and should be compatible with your application's setup.

Remember, the `oauth` section is optional and only needed if you're configuring OAuth with Amazon Cognito. If you're using username/password-based authentication without OAuth, you can omit that section.

Always refer to the latest [AWS Amplify Documentation](https://docs.amplify.aws/) for the most current information and best practices. The documentation provides comprehensive guides and examples for setting up authentication and other services with AWS Amplify.

The Gen 2 documentation says to load `Amplify.config()` directly in `main.tsx`, so I put the settings into an `AmplifyConfigure.ts` and am trying to load them in `main.tsx` but I get this:

```tsx

The error you're encountering indicates a type mismatch between the object you're passing to `Amplify.configure()` and what the method expects. Based on the message, it seems the configuration object you've created does not match the expected structure for an Amplify configuration.

From the details provided, it appears your `AmplifyConfigure.ts` might be missing the parent `Auth` key that encapsulates the authentication configuration. AWS Amplify expects configurations to be structured with service names as top-level keys, such as `Auth` for authentication-related settings.

Here's how you should structure your `AmplifyConfigure.ts` to ensure it matches the expected type:

```typescript
// AmplifyConfigure.ts
export const AmplifyConfigure = {
  Auth: {
    authenticationFlowType: 'USER_PASSWORD_AUTH',
    region: 'us-east-1', // Replace with your Cognito User Pool region
    userPoolId: 'us-east-1_example', // Replace with your Cognito User Pool ID
    userPoolWebClientId: 'example', // Replace with your Cognito App Client ID
    // Include other necessary configuration options here
  }
  // You can include other service configurations here as needed
};
```

Then, in your `main.tsx`, you should import this configuration and use it with `Amplify.configure()` like so:

```tsx
// main.tsx
import Amplify from 'aws-amplify';
import { AmplifyConfigure } from './AmplifyConfigure';

Amplify.configure(AmplifyConfigure);
```

This structure should resolve the TypeScript error you're encountering by correctly typing the configuration object. Make sure the `AmplifyConfigure` object includes all necessary keys and values for your specific use case, especially under the `Auth` key for authentication settings.

If you continue to face issues, ensure that your AWS Amplify library versions are up to date and compatible with each other. It's also a good idea to reference the [official AWS Amplify documentation](https://docs.amplify.aws/) for the most current guidance on configuring the library for your project.

That gives me this error:

The error you're encountering indicates a type mismatch between your configuration object and what's expected by the `Amplify.configure()` method in AWS Amplify's TypeScript definitions. The specific types mentioned in the error, `ResourcesConfig`, `LegacyConfig`, or `AmplifyOutputs`, suggest there's a discrepancy with how the configuration is structured or interpreted in the context of AWS Amplify's expected types.

Given this, and considering the structure of your `AmplifyConfigure` object, it seems like the issue might stem from the strict type checking of TypeScript against the AWS Amplify library's type definitions. Here are a few steps to troubleshoot and potentially resolve this issue:

### Step 1: Ensure Correct Amplify and TypeScript Versions

First, ensure you're using compatible versions of AWS Amplify and TypeScript. Incompatibilities or significant version differences can sometimes lead to unexpected type errors. You're using AWS Amplify 6.x, which should be compatible with recent TypeScript versions, but it's still good to verify.

### Step 2: Check for Amplify Library Updates

Ensure your AWS Amplify library is up to date. If there have been updates or fixes related to TypeScript type definitions, updating could resolve your issue.

```bash
npm install aws-amplify@latest
```

or, if you're using Yarn:

```bash
yarn add aws-amplify@latest
```

### Step 3: Verify and Simplify the Configuration Object

Your `AmplifyConfigure` object's structure seems correct for a typical Amplify Auth configuration. However, TypeScript's complaint suggests it's expecting a type that doesn't align with your object. To potentially bypass this issue, you can try simplifying the process:

```typescript
// Directly inside main.tsx or wherever you're configuring Amplify

import Amplify from 'aws-amplify';

const amplifyConfig = {
  Auth: {
    authenticationFlowType: 'USER_PASSWORD_AUTH',
    region: 'your-region',
    userPoolId: 'your-user-pool-id',
    userPoolWebClientId: 'your-client-id',
  },
};

Amplify.configure(amplifyConfig);
```

This approach minimizes potential issues by defining the configuration in the same file where it's used, reducing complexity.

### Step 4: Bypassing TypeScript Checks (As Last Resort)

As a last resort, if you're confident in your configuration but blocked by TypeScript errors, you can bypass TypeScript checks for this specific line:

```typescript
Amplify.configure(amplifyConfig as any);
```

This is not generally recommended because it circumvents the type system, but it can be useful temporarily if you're blocked and the configuration is known to be correct.

### Step 5: Consult AWS Amplify Documentation and Community

If the issue persists, consult the [AWS Amplify Documentation](https://docs.amplify.aws/) for any recent changes or notes on TypeScript compatibility. Additionally, searching or asking for help in community forums or the AWS Amplify GitHub issues might reveal others who have encountered and solved similar problems.

Given the nature of the error and the steps outlined, there should be a path forward to either resolving the type mismatch or identifying a specific aspect of the configuration or environment that's causing the issue.
