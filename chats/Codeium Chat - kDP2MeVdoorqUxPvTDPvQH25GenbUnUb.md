I am in the process of converting my `Hero.tsx` and `Zombie.tsx` into functional components that use `useBaseCharacter` instead of classes that inherited from `BaseCharacter` class component, as they had done.

I need to get the list of Actions from the Hero and Zombie, and I need to get their current sprite, so that I can invoke the `draw` method on the current sprite from the `TerminalGame`.

How can the `TerminalGame` refer to these?

```tsx
    <Hero
     ref={this.heroRef}
     currentActionType={this.props.heroAction}
     onGetSprites={this.onGetHeroSprites}
     onGetActions={this.onGetHeroActions}
    />
    <Zombie4
     ref={this.zombie4Ref}
     currentActionType={this.props.zombie4Action}
     onGetSprites={this.onGetZombie4Sprites}
    />
```

Since you're using functional components for `Hero` and `Zombie4`, you should consider using React hooks such as `useImperativeHandle` in conjunction with `forwardRef` to expose specific methods to the parent `TerminalGame` component. The methods you expose can be used to get the list of actions and the current sprite.

Here's an example of how you might modify `Hero` and `Zombie4` to use `forwardRef` and `useImperativeHandle`:

```tsx
import React, { useImperativeHandle, forwardRef } from 'react';

// In Hero.tsx
export const Hero = forwardRef((props, ref) => {
  const baseCharacter = useBaseCharacter({
    // ...props and other setup
  });

  useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({
    getCurrentSprite: () => baseCharacter.getCurrentSprite(),
    getActions: () => baseCharacter.getActions(),
  }));

  // ...rest of the component
});

// In Zombie4.tsx
export const Zombie4 = forwardRef((props, ref) => {
  const baseCharacter = useBaseCharacter({
    // ...props and other setup
  });

  useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({
    getCurrentSprite: () => baseCharacter.getCurrentSprite(),
    getActions: () => baseCharacter.getActions(),
  }));

  // ...rest of the component
});
```

In the `TerminalGame` component, you can now call these methods:

```tsx
// Assuming you've created refs using React.createRef()
const heroSprite = this.heroRef.current?.getCurrentSprite();
const heroActions = this.heroRef.current?.getActions();
const zombieSprite = this.zombie4Ref.current?.getCurrentSprite();
const zombieActions = this.zombie4Ref.current?.getActions();

// You can now use these in your game logic and call the draw method
heroSprite?.draw();
zombieSprite?.draw();
```

Please ensure that the `useBaseCharacter` hook provides `getCurrentSprite` and `getActions` methods that return the current sprite and the list of actions, respectively. Adjust the names and implementation details based on your actual code structure and naming conventions.

The error is indicating that your `Hero` component is not returning anything (`void`), but it should return a valid React element (`ReactNode`). When using `forwardRef`, the component must return renderable JSX.

To fix this, make sure you return some JSX from your `Hero` component. If the component doesn't render anything itself, you can return `null` or some placeholder. Here's an example fix:

```tsx
// Hero.tsx

import React, { useBaseCharacter } from "./useBaseCharacter";
import { HeroActions } from "./types/ActionTypes";
import { ICharacterProps } from "./ICharacterProps";
import { forwardRef, useImperativeHandle } from "react";

export const getActions = () => {
  return HeroActions;
}

export const Hero = forwardRef((props: ICharacterProps, ref) => {

  // Use the custom hook for shared logic with BaseCharacter
  const baseCharacter = useBaseCharacter({
    actions: HeroActions,
    currentActionType: props.currentActionType,
    name: 'Hero',
    onGetSprites: props.onGetSprites,
  });

  useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({
    getCurrentSprite: () => baseCharacter.getCurrentSprite(),
    getActions: () => baseCharacter.getActions(),
  }));

  // If the Hero component does not render anything, return null.
  return null;
});
```

This should resolve the TypeScript error you're encountering. Make sure your `useBaseCharacter` hook provides the `getCurrentSprite` and `getActions` methods and that they return the correct types.

This error suggests that the `useBaseCharacter` hook might return `null` under certain conditions, and TypeScript is warning you that you're trying to access properties or methods on a value that could potentially be `null`.

To address this, you should ensure that `baseCharacter` is not `null` before trying to use it. You can add a guard to check if `baseCharacter` is not `null` before using it inside `useImperativeHandle`. Here's how you might adjust your code:

```tsx
// Hero.tsx

// ... (other imports)
import { forwardRef, useImperativeHandle } from "react";

// ... (rest of your component)

export const Hero = forwardRef((props: ICharacterProps, ref) => {
  // Use the custom hook for shared logic with BaseCharacter
  const baseCharacter = useBaseCharacter({
    // ... (props setup)
  });

  useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({
    getCurrentSprite: () => baseCharacter ? baseCharacter.getCurrentSprite() : null,
    getActions: () => baseCharacter ? baseCharacter.getActions() : null,
  }));

  // ... (rest of your component)

  return null; // or your JSX here
});

```

By using the ternary operator `? :`, you're saying "if `baseCharacter` is not `null`, call the method, otherwise return `null`". This ensures that you're not trying to call a method on a `null` value.

Make sure to check the logic within `useBaseCharacter` to understand why it might return `null` and handle those cases appropriately within your component. If `useBaseCharacter` should never return `null`, you might need to refactor it to always return a valid object with the necessary methods.

How do I add `getCurrentSprite` to this?

```tsx
import { useEffect, useRef, useState } from 'react';
import { Sprite } from './sprites/Sprite';
import { SpriteAnimation } from './types/SpriteTypes';
import { Action, ActionType } from './types/ActionTypes';

To add `getCurrentSprite` to your `useBaseCharacter` hook, you can simply define it as a function that retrieves the current sprite from the `spritesRef` based on `props.currentActionType`. Since you already have a similar function named `onGetSprites`, you can rename it to `getCurrentSprite` or use it as is.

Here's how you can add or rename the function:

```tsx
export const useBaseCharacter = (props: BaseCharacterProps) => {
  // ... existing code ...

  const getCurrentSprite = () => {
    // Just return the current sprite
    let currentSprite = spritesRef.current[props.currentActionType];
    return currentSprite || null; // Return null if the sprite is not found
  };

  // ... rest of your hook ...

  // Instead of returning null, you return an object with the functions you want to expose
  return {
    getCurrentSprite, // Now this can be called from the component using this hook
    // ... any other values or functions you want to expose from this hook ...
  };
};
```

Now, components that use this hook can call `getCurrentSprite` to get the sprite for the current action type. Remember to include `getCurrentSprite` in the returned object from the hook, so it's accessible to the components.

When you use the hook in a component, like in your `Hero` component, you can now directly call `baseCharacter.getCurrentSprite()` to get the current sprite. Since you're returning an object from the hook, make sure to check for `null` to avoid trying to access properties on a `null` value in the component or when you expose methods through `useImperativeHandle`.

I have more questions but first, could you explain in detail what it is we did by adding `forwardRef`? How does that work, and how did it help us do what we are doing? It appears to be working, but I want to know all about why it is working.

---

**Codeium** _at 5:02 pm, Jun 10, 2024_

Certainly! `forwardRef` is a React feature that lets you pass a `ref` through a component to one of its children. This is useful when you need to access a child's DOM node or React instance directly from a parent component. 

When you use `forwardedRef`, you're creating a higher-order component that can receive a `ref` as a parameter and then forward it to a child component. It's important to note that you cannot use the `ref` attribute on functional components because they don't have instances; `forwardRef` provides a way around this limitation.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of what we did with `forwardRef` and why it works:

1. **Creating a Ref Forwarding Component**:
   We wrapped the `Hero` component with `forwardRef`. This allows the `Hero` component to receive a `ref` passed from a parent component, even though `Hero` is a functional component.

2. **Accessing the Ref Inside the Component**:
   Inside the `Hero` component, we received this `ref` as the second argument of the component function. This `ref` can then be associated with a DOM element or used in `useImperativeHandle`.

3. **Exposing Specific Methods**:
   We used the `useImperativeHandle` hook in conjunction with the `ref` to expose specific methods (`getCurrentSprite` and `getActions`) to the parent component. This is useful when you want the parent to access specific functionality of the child component but don't want to expose the entire instance.

4. **Using the Exposed Methods in the Parent Component**:
   In the parent component (`TerminalGame`), when we render `Hero`, we can assign a `ref` (created by `React.createRef()` or `useRef()`). Thanks to `forwardRef` and `useImperativeHandle`, we can call the methods we exposed (`ref.current.getCurrentSprite()` and `ref.current.getActions()`) directly from the parent component.

The `useImperativeHandle` hook customizes the instance value that is exposed when using `ref`. Without `useImperativeHandle`, the `ref` would point to the default value, which is the DOM node in the case of DOM elements, or `null` for functional components. By using `useImperativeHandle`, you have control over what is exposed to the parent component, making it a powerful tool for parent-child interaction.

Here's a simplified example to illustrate the concept:

```tsx
import React, { forwardRef, useImperativeHandle, useRef } from 'react';

const Child = forwardRef((props, ref) => {
  useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({
    sayHello: () => {
      console.log('Hello from Child!');
    },
  }));

  return <div>Child Component</div>;
});

const Parent = () => {
  const childRef = useRef();

  const handleClick = () => {
    if (childRef.current) {
      childRef.current.sayHello();
    }
  };

  return (
    <>
      <Child ref={childInteract} />
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Call Child Method</button>
    </>
  );
};
```

In this example, `Parent` can call the `sayHello` method on `Child`, even though `Child` is a functional component without an instance. This is made possible by `forwardRef` and `useImperativeHandle`.

Ok, can you help me understand why this is giving me errors, then?

This is from `TerminalGame`

```tsx
 private heroSprite = this.heroRef.current?.getCurrentSprite();
 private heroActions = this.heroRef.current?.getHeroActions();
 private zombieSprite = this.zombie4Ref.current?.getCurrentSprite();
 private zombieActions = this.zombie4Ref.current?.getActions();
```
which gives error: `Property 'getCurrentSprite' does not exist on type '{}'.ts(2339)
Codeium: Explain Problem
⚠ Error(TS2339)  | 
Property getCurrentSprite does not exist on type {}.`

And, 
```tsx
    <Hero
     ref={this.heroRef}
     currentActionType='Idle'
     onGetCurrentSprite={this.getCurrentHeroSprite}
     onGetActions={this.getHeroActions}
    />
    <Zombie4
     ref={this.zombie4Ref}
     currentActionType='Walk'
     onGetCurrentSprite={this.onGetZombie4Sprite}
     onGetActions={this.onGetZombie4Actions}
    />
```

Which gives error:

**Codeium** _at 5:45 pm, Jun 10, 2024_

The TypeScript errors you're encountering indicate that TypeScript doesn't know the specific type of object that `heroRef.current` and `zombie4Ref.current` are referring to. By default, `ref.current` is typed as `{}` (an empty object), which doesn't have the methods you're trying to call.

To resolve these errors, you need to define an interface that includes the methods you're adding via `useImperativeHandle` and then use that interface as the type for your refs. Here's how you can do it:

1. Define an interface that describes the methods you want to call on the ref:

```tsx
// Define an interface for the ref methods
interface CharacterRefMethods {
  getCurrentSprite: () => Sprite | null;
  getActions: () => Record<ActionType, Action>;
}

// Update your ref definitions with the correct type
private heroRef = React.createRef<CharacterRefMethods>();
private zombie4Ref = React.createRef<CharacterRefMethods>();
```

2. Now, when you use these refs, TypeScript will know that `heroRef.current` and `zombie4Ref.current` will either be `null` or an object with the `getCurrentSprite` and `getActions` methods, preventing the error.

Regarding the second part, the props `onGetCurrentSprite` and `onGetActions` you're trying to pass to `Hero` and `Zombie4` components don't seem to match the expected props defined in `ICharacterProps`. If you intend to pass callback functions to these components, you should first ensure that `ICharacterProps` includes these callback properties. If you're trying to call methods on the child components (which seems to be the case), you don't need to pass them as props since you're already using `ref` to call methods on the child instances.

Here's what the `ICharacterProps` interface should look like if you want to pass callbacks:

```tsx
interface ICharacterProps {
  currentActionType: ActionType;
  // Add callback types if necessary
  onGetCurrentSprite?: () => Sprite | null;
  onGetActions?: () => Record<ActionType, Action>;
  // ... other properties
}
```

But given the context, it seems you're not supposed to pass callbacks, but rather you should use the `ref` to call methods on the child components directly. So your `Hero` and `Zombie4` usages would be like this:

```tsx
// You don't need to pass onGetCurrentSprite and onGetActions as props
<Hero
  ref={this.heroRef}
  currentActionType='Idle'
/>
<Zombie4
  ref={this.zombie4Ref}
  currentActionType='Walk'
/>
```

And you would call `getCurrentSprite` and `getActions` elsewhere in your `TerminalGame` component, probably in a lifecycle method or an event handler after the component has mounted and the refs have been populated.

**User** _at 6:22 pm, Jun 10, 2024_

If I want to access these variables in `TerminalGame`, shouldn't I load them in `componentDidMount`?

```tsx
 private heroSprite = this.heroRef.current?.getCurrentSprite();
 private heroActions = this.heroRef.current?.getActions();
 private zombieSprite = this.zombie4Ref.current?.getCurrentSprite();
 private zombieActions = this.zombie4Ref.current?.getActions();
```

---

**Codeium** _at 6:22 pm, Jun 10, 2024_

Yes, you're correct. Accessing the refs immediately in the constructor or during the initial render will not work because the child components have not been mounted yet, and thus the refs are not populated. To access the methods `getCurrentSprite` and `getActions` from the refs, you should do so in the `componentDidMount` lifecycle method or in a `useEffect` hook if you were using functional components with hooks.

Here's how you could modify your `TerminalGame` class component to access these methods in `componentDidMount`:

```tsx
class TerminalGame extends React.Component<ITerminalGameProps, ITerminalGameState> {
  private heroRef = React.createRef<CharacterRefMethods>();
  private zombie4Ref = React.createRef<CharacterRefMethods>();

  private heroSprite: Sprite | null = null;
  private heroActions: Record<ActionType, Action> | null = null;
  private zombieSprite: Sprite | null = null;
  private zombieActions: Record<ActionType, Action> | null = null;

  componentDidMount() {
    this.heroSprite = this.heroRef.current?.getCurrentSprite();
    this.heroActions = this.heroRef.current?.getActions();
    this.zombieSprite = this.zombie4Ref.current?.getCurrentSprite();
    this.zombieActions = this.zombie4Ref.current?.getActions();

    // Now you can use this.heroSprite, this.heroActions, etc.
    // Just make sure to check if they are not null before using
  }

  // ... rest of your component ...
}
```

By moving the assignments to `componentDidMount`, you ensure that the child components (`Hero` and `Zombie4`) have been mounted and that their refs are set. Remember that you might need to handle updates to these properties if the child components update their sprites or actions. In such cases, you would also use the `componentDidUpdate` lifecycle method to keep these properties in sync.

This pattern assumes that the sprites and actions are not changing frequently. If they do change often, it might be better to call the ref methods (`getCurrentSprite` and `getActions`) directly where you need the current sprite and actions, rather than storing them as properties on the `TerminalGame` class.

**User** _at 7:10 pm, Jun 10, 2024_

While I was implementing that, I think I figured out that the `TerminalGame` doesn't need to know abou the list of character actions or the current sprite if it just calls the `draw` method exposed by the `useBaseCharacter` which calls the `draw` method on the `Sprite`, which will have the animation information, as long as I pass it the canvas context and the position.

`useBaseCharacter`:

```tsx
 const draw = (
  context: CanvasRenderingContext2D, 
  position: SpritePosition
 ) =>{
  const sprite = spritesRef.current[props.currentActionType];
  // props.context.clearRect(position.leftX + 30, position.topY, 44, 80);
  if (sprite) {
   sprite.draw(
    context,
    frameIndexRef.current,
    position.leftX,
    position.topY,
    2
   );
  }
 }

 return {
  getCurrentSprite,
  draw
 };
```

However, when I try to do this in `TerminalGame` in the animation loop after the background renders:

```tsx
  if(this.heroRef.current && this.context) {
   this.heroRef.current.draw(this.context, this.state.heroPosition);
  }
  if(this.zombie4Ref.current && this.context) {
   this.zombie4Ref.current.draw(this.context, this.state.zombie4Position);
  }
```

The browser tells me:

```

TerminalGame.tsx:309  
Uncaught TypeError: this.heroRef.current.draw is not a function
    at TerminalGame.updateCharacterAndBackground (TerminalGame.tsx:309:28)

```

**Codeium** _at 7:10 pm, Jun 10, 2024_

The error message you're encountering indicates that the `draw` function is not being correctly exposed to the `TerminalGame` component via the `ref`. To ensure that the `draw` function is accessible, you need to include it in the object returned by `useImperativeHandle` within your `Hero` and `Zombie4` components.

Here's how you should be using `useImperativeHandle` in your `Hero` and `Zombie4` components to expose the `draw` function:

```tsx
import React, { useImperativeHandle, forwardRef } from 'react';

// Inside your Hero component
const Hero = forwardRef((props, ref) => {
  const { draw, getCurrentSprite } = useBaseCharacter({
    // Props passed to useBaseCharacter
  });

  useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({
    draw,
    getCurrentSprite,
    // ... any other methods you want to expose
  }));

  // ... rest of the Hero component
  return <div>Hero Component</div>;
});

// The Zombie4 component would have a similar structure
```

Make sure that you're exposing the `draw` function in both your `Hero` and `Zombie4` components. Also, ensure that you've updated the `CharacterRefMethods` interface to include the `draw` method:

```tsx
interface CharacterRefMethods {
  getCurrentSprite: () => Sprite | null;
  getActions: () => Record<ActionType, Action>;
  draw: (context: CanvasRenderingContext2D, position: { x: number, y: number }) => void;
}
```

After doing this, when you call `this.heroRef.current.draw` or `this.zombie4Ref.current.draw` in your `TerminalGame` component, it should correctly call the `draw` function provided by the `useBaseCharacter` hook.

Remember to bind these methods to `this` or use arrow functions to ensure that the correct `this` context is used when the methods are called. This is especially important if the methods inside `useBaseCharacter` rely on `this` to access other properties or methods of the hook. If you're using arrow functions, as shown in the example above, the context (`this`) is automatically bound.

My app seems to be creating about 1000 DOM Nodes per second now, and not doing much else.

This concerns me.

---

**Codeium** _at 7:41 pm, Jun 10, 2024_

Creating a large number of DOM nodes at such a rate is a red flag for a memory leak or a performance issue, often due to unnecessary re-renders or improper DOM manipulation. Here's a general approach to troubleshoot and address this:

1. **Verify Component Updates**: Ensure components are only updating when necessary. Use `React.memo` for functional components or `PureComponent` for class components to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

2. **Check for Imperative DOM Manipulations**: If you're manipulating the DOM directly (outside of React's rendering cycle), ensure that you properly clean up created nodes. For instance, if you create DOM nodes in a `useEffect` without cleaning them up, they can accumulate.

3. **Use Keys in Lists**: When rendering lists, always use unique and stable keys for each item to help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.

4. **Inspect useEffect and Event Listeners**: Make sure any `useEffect` hooks have correct dependency arrays to avoid them running more than necessary. Also, ensure you clean up event listeners when components unmount.

5. **Profile the Application**: Use the React Developer Tools to profile the application. Look for components that mount and unmount frequently or update excessively.

6. **Check for State Updates in a Loop**: Ensure there are no unintended continuous state updates that could cause a component to re-render in a loop.

7. **Audit External Libraries**: If you're using external libraries for DOM manipulation or animations, ensure they're not the source of the issue.

Given your specific context of using refs and canvas drawing in a game loop, you should ensure that:

- The game loop is not creating new components or elements in each iteration.
- State updates within the loop are batched or minimized to prevent re-renders.
- Any time you create DOM nodes (like canvases), you remove them during cleanup.

If you're still unable to identify the source of the issue, please provide more details or code snippets related to where you suspect the DOM nodes are being created, and I can offer more targeted advice.

Every time I cycle through the animation loop I get 10 new DOM nodes and 7 new event listeners.

---

**Codeium** _at 8:45 pm, Jun 10, 2024_

The DOM nodes and event listeners increasing with each animation loop cycle suggest that something within your animation loop is causing React components to mount without unmounting previous instances, or you're adding event listeners without removing them later. Here are steps to debug and resolve this issue:

1. **Review Animation Loop Code**: Look at the code inside your animation loop. Ensure that it doesn't contain any React component rendering or DOM manipulation logic that inadvertently creates new elements or mounts components.

2. **Inspect Event Listeners**: If you're adding event listeners in the animation loop or in a component that's part of the loop, make sure to remove them. Event listeners should typically be added in `componentDidMount` or `useEffect` with an empty dependency array, and removed in `componentWillUnmount` or the cleanup function of `useEffect`.

3. **Check Component Mounting**: Ensure that components involved in the animation are not being remounted on each loop iteration. Components should only mount once and then update if needed.

4. **Canvas Drawing**: If you're using canvas and manipulating it through React, make sure you're not creating new canvases or context objects in each frame. You should create a single canvas and then just update its context in the loop.

5. **Use `key` Prop Correctly**: If you're rendering lists of elements within the loop, ensure each element has a unique `key` prop to prevent unnecessary re-rendering and element creation.

6. **Profiling**: Use the React DevTools profiler to see which components are mounting, updating, and unmounting. It can help you identify unexpected behavior.

7. **Check for Memory Leaks**: Look for any closures that might be capturing large objects or a large number of objects, leading to memory leaks.

8. **Optimize State Updates**: If your loop involves updating the state, make sure that you're doing so optimally. Unnecessary state updates can lead to unexpected component behavior.

If you could share more specific code from your animation loop, especially the parts where you suspect the issue might be occurring, I could provide more detailed assistance.

I am going to show you the few files that are involved with the changes that result in DOM Node explosion.

Here is one. Do you see  anything of concern?

```tsx
// Level.tsx
import React from 'react';
import {ParallaxBackground, IParallaxLayer } from './ParallaxBackground';

interface ILevelProps {
 level: number;
 backgroundOffsetX: number;
 canvasWidth: number;
 canvasHeight: number;
 canvasRef: React.RefObject<HTMLCanvasElement>;
}

export const getParallaxLayers = (level: number): IParallaxLayer[] => {
 const layers: IParallaxLayer[][] = [
  // Level 1 layers
  [
   { imageSrc: '/images/parallax-industrial-pack/parallax-industrial-pack/layers/skill-desc_0002_far-buildings.png', scale: 0.8, movementRate: 0.4 },
   { imageSrc: '/images/parallax-industrial-pack/parallax-industrial-pack/layers/skill-desc_0001_buildings.png', scale: 0.6, movementRate: 0.6 },
   { imageSrc: '/images/parallax-industrial-pack/parallax-industrial-pack/layers/skill-desc_0000_foreground.png', scale: 0.6, movementRate: 1 },
  ],
  // Level 2 layers
  [
   { imageSrc: '/images/cyberpunk-street-files/cyberpunk-street-files/PNG/layers/far-buildings.png', scale: 0.6, movementRate: 0.4 },
   { imageSrc: '/images/cyberpunk-street-files/cyberpunk-street-files/PNG/layers/back-buildings.png', scale: 0.8, movementRate: 0.6 },
   { imageSrc: '/images/cyberpunk-street-files/cyberpunk-street-files/PNG/layers/foreground.png', scale: 1, movementRate: 1 },
  ],
  // Add more levels as needed
 ];

 console.log('getParallaxLayers called with level:', level);
 // Ensure the level index is within bounds, defaulting to level 1 if out of bounds
 const levelIndex = level - 1; // Adjust for zero-based index
 return layers[levelIndex] || layers[0];
};

export const Level: React.FC<ILevelProps> = ({ level, backgroundOffsetX, canvasWidth, canvasHeight, canvasRef }) => {
 const layers = React.useMemo(() => {

  // Function to get parallax layers based on the level
  // Use getParallaxLayers to get the layers for the current level
  return getParallaxLayers(level);
 }, [level]);

 return (
  <>

   />
   {/* Render your characters and other level elements here */}
  </>
 );
};
```

The `Level` component itself doesn't appear to be the direct cause of the DOM node increase. It's a functional component that uses `useMemo` to memoize the parallax layers, and it renders the `ParallaxBackground` component with the correct props. There are no obvious signs of issues like DOM manipulation or event listener registration that would cause the symptoms you're describing.

However, the real cause might be hidden in the details of how the `ParallaxBackground` component is implemented or how the `Level` component is used within the rest of your application. Here are some things to consider:

- **ParallaxBackground Implementation**: Look into the `ParallaxBackground` component to see if it's creating new DOM elements or adding event listeners without proper cleanup.
- **Re-rendering**: Verify how often the `Level` component re-renders. If it's re-rendering too often, it could be triggering re-renders down the component tree, which might cause issues if children are not optimized.
- **Use of `canvasRef`**: Check how the `canvasRef` is being used. If new canvases are created on each render without removing the previous ones, it could lead to a buildup of DOM nodes.
- **Console Logging**: The `console.log` in `getParallaxLayers` will execute every time the component re-renders and the `level` prop changes. While this isn't a direct cause of the DOM increase, excessive logging can clutter your console and obscure real issues.
- **Component Usage**: Look at all places where `Level` is used in your application. Ensure that it's not being unmounted and remounted repeatedly, as this could cause issues if the `Level` component or its children have side effects that are not cleaned up properly.

If you don't find the issue within this component, it would be helpful to inspect the `ParallaxBackground` component, the parent components that render `Level`, and any other components rendered alongside or within `Level` for potential causes of the DOM node increase.

The `ParallaxBackground` is here:

```tsx
// ParallaxBackground.tsx
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';

export interface IParallaxLayer {
  imageSrc: string;
  scale: number;
  movementRate: number;
}

export interface ParallaxBackgroundProps {
  layers: IParallaxLayer[];
  offset: number; // This prop is the backgroundOffsetX from your game state
  canvasWidth: number;
  canvasHeight: number;
  canvasRef: React.RefObject<HTMLCanvasElement>;
}

export const drawParallaxLayer = (

  canvasHeight: number
) => {
  const { imageSrc, scale, movementRate } = layer;
  const image = new Image();
  image.src = imageSrc;

  // Wait for the image to load before drawing

    // Calculate the horizontal position based on the movement rate
    const x = -offset * movementRate;

    // Calculate the scaled dimensions of the image
    const scaledWidth = image.width * scale;
    const scaledHeight = image.height * scale;

    // Calculate how many times to draw the image to fill the canvas width
    const numImages = Math.ceil(canvasWidth / scaledWidth);

    // Draw the image as many times as needed to create the parallax effect
    for (let i = 0; i <= numImages; i++) {
      context.drawImage(
        image,
        x + i * scaledWidth % canvasWidth, // X position (looping the image)
        canvasHeight - scaledHeight,    // Y position (align to bottom)
        scaledWidth,           // Scaled width
        scaledHeight           // Scaled height
      );
    }
  };

    const x = -offset * movementRate;
    const scaledWidth = image.width * scale;
    const scaledHeight = image.height * scale;

    }
    console.log('ParallaxBackground rendered', layers, offset, canvasWidth, canvasHeight, canvasRef);
  }, [layers, offset, canvasWidth, canvasHeight, canvasRef]);

  // The canvas is rendered by the parent component (TerminalGame)
  return null;
};
```

The `ParallaxBackground` component is designed to update a canvas element using a `ref`. The actual drawing occurs in the `drawParallaxLayer` function. There is nothing in the `ParallaxBackground` component itself that would cause an increase in DOM nodes, as the component returns `null` and does not render any DOM elements directly.

However, the `drawParallaxLayer` function creates a new `Image` object for each layer every time it's called. If this function is being called repeatedly in a tight loop, the creation of `Image` objects could be the cause of your performance issues, even though they are not DOM nodes themselves.

Each `Image` object may be registering event listeners for the `load` event. If `drawParallaxLayer` is being called very frequently, those event listeners might not be getting a chance to be garbage collected, especially if the images are large and take a while to load. This could contribute to a seeming increase in event listeners and memory usage.

To mitigate this, you could optimize `drawParallaxLayer` in a few ways:

1. **Cache Images**: Instead of creating a new `Image` object every time, cache the images so that each one is only loaded once. You can store them in a state or ref and reuse them for drawing.
2. **Load Images Separately**: You could load all the images when the component mounts or when the `layers` prop changes, instead of loading them on every draw call.
3. **Cleanup**: Ensure that any resources created during the drawing process are properly cleaned up if they're no longer needed.

Here's an example of how you might cache the images:

```tsx
export const ParallaxBackground: React.FC<ParallaxBackgroundProps> = ({ layers, offset, canvasWidth, canvasHeight, canvasRef }) => {
  // State to hold the loaded images
  const [loadedImages, setLoadedImages] = useState<Map<string, HTMLImageElement>>(new Map());

  useEffect(() => {
    // Load the images when the layers change
    const newLoadedImages = new Map();
    layers.forEach(layer => {
      if (!loadedImages.has(layer.imageSrc)) {
        const image = new Image();
        image.src = layer.imageSrc;
        image.onload = () => {
          newLoadedImages.set(layer.imageSrc, image);
          setLoadedImages(newLoadedImages);
        };
      }
    });
  }, [layers]);

  useEffect(() => {
    const canvas = canvasRef.current;
    const context = canvas?.getContext('2d');
    if (context) {
      // Clear the canvas before drawing the new frame
      context.clearRect(0, 0, canvasWidth, canvasHeight);

      // Draw each layer using the cached images
      layers.forEach(layer => {
        const image = loadedImages.get(layer.imageSrc);
        if (image) {
          drawParallaxLayer(context, layer, offset, canvasWidth, canvasHeight, image);
        }
      });
    }
  }, [layers, offset, canvasWidth, canvasHeight, canvasRef, loadedImages]);

  // The canvas is rendered by the parent component (TerminalGame)
  return null;
};

// Update drawParallaxLayer to accept an HTMLImageElement instead of creating a new Image
function drawParallaxLayer(
  context: CanvasRenderingContext2D,
  layer: IParallaxLayer,
  offset: number,
  canvasWidth: number,
  canvasHeight: number,
  image: HTMLImageElement
) {
  // Existing drawing logic...
}

```

This change ensures each image is only loaded once and then reused for drawing. Remember to handle cases where images may fail to load and provide a fallback or retry mechanism if necessary.

That looks very helpful. I should only have to load different parallax background images when a level changes. The rest of the time they should be cached.

When exactly in the code is the image loaded from the image file? What is the role of the HTML `new Image()` if the image is drawn to the `canvas`?

---

**Codeium** _at 9:12 pm, Jun 10, 2024_

The `new Image()` constructor in JavaScript is used to create a new HTMLImageElement, which is an in-memory representation of an image. This element is not automatically part of the DOM and will not be visible on the page until you explicitly add it to the DOM or draw it onto a canvas.

Here's the process of loading and using an image in the context of your `ParallaxBackground` component:

1. **Image Creation**: When you call `new Image()`, a new HTMLImageElement is created. At this point, it does not yet contain any image data.

2. **Setting `src` Attribute**: You then set the `src` attribute of this image element to the URL of the image file you want to load (`image.src = imageSrc;`). This action initiates the loading of the image from the server.

3. **Loading**: The browser requests the image from the server using the URL provided. The loading happens asynchronously in the background.

4. **Onload Event**: Once the image is fully loaded and ready to use, the `onload` event is fired. This is where you can safely draw the image onto the canvas since you know the image data is fully available.

5. **Drawing to Canvas**: Using `context.drawImage()`, you can then draw the loaded image onto a canvas element. The image is rendered onto the canvas based on the parameters you provide, such as the position and size.

The role of the HTML `new Image()` is to provide a way to programmatically load images and use them in JavaScript, which is particularly useful when working with the canvas API. By drawing an image onto the canvas, you're effectively rendering that image within the canvas's pixel grid, allowing for complex graphical operations, animations, and effects.

In the context of your game, you'd typically want to load the parallax background images once per level, draw them onto the canvas to create the visual background, and then simply shift their positions or redraw as needed to achieve the parallax scrolling effect as the player moves through the level. Caching these images, as previously discussed, avoids unnecessary network requests and performance issues by reusing the already loaded images.

---

**User** _at 9:37 pm, Jun 10, 2024_

Yes. the parallax images are tiles of the background, so they only need to be loaded once per level change.

Is that what we're doing?

We are creating an additional image in here:

```tsx
  useEffect(() => {
    // Load the images when the layers change
    const newLoadedImages = new Map();
    layers.forEach(layer => {
      if (!loadedImages.has(layer.imageSrc)) {
        const image = new Image();
        image.src = layer.imageSrc;
        image.onload = () => {
          newLoadedImages.set(layer.imageSrc, image);
          setLoadedImages(newLoadedImages);
        };
      }
    });
  }, [layers]);
```

---

**Codeium** _at 9:37 pm, Jun 10, 2024_

Yes, that's the intention of the code within the `useEffect`. However, there's a mistake in the logic that could lead to images being reloaded unnecessarily. The issue is that `newLoadedImages` is a new `Map` created on each execution of `useEffect`, and since `loadedImages` is not a dependency of this `useEffect`, it will always be an empty map when this effect runs. This means the condition `!loadedImages.has(layer.imageSrc)` will always be `true`, and the image will be loaded again, even if it's already in the state.

The `setLoadedImages(newLoadedImages)` call inside the `image.onload` callback will update the component's state, causing the component to re-render, which could lead to a new execution of this `useEffect` and potentially create a loop if `layers` changes as a result.

To fix this and ensure that each image is only loaded once, you should modify the logic as follows:

1. Initialize `loadedImages` with an empty `Map` and update it only when images are loaded.
2. Remove `loadedImages` from the dependency array of the `useEffect` that loads images to avoid it triggering on every state update.
3. Use a functional state update to ensure you're adding to the current state rather than overwriting it.

Here's an updated version of the code:

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  // This effect runs once on mount and whenever 'layers' changes.
  layers.forEach(layer => {
    if (!loadedImages.has(layer.imageSrc)) {
      const image = new Image();
      image.src = layer.imageSrc;
      image.onload = () => {
        // Use a functional update to correctly merge with the existing map
        setLoadedImages(prevLoadedImages => {
          const updatedLoadedImages = new Map(prevLoadedImages);
          updatedLoadedImages.set(layer.imageSrc, image);
          return updatedLoadedImages;
        });
      };
    }
  });
  // We only want to run this effect when 'layers' changes, not 'loadedImages'.
}, [layers]);
```

With this updated code, images are loaded only once when the `layers` prop changes, which should happen when you change levels. Each `Image` object is added to the `loadedImages` map, and because we use a functional update for setting state, we ensure that we're always working with the current state. This should prevent unnecessary image reloads and avoid the creation of extraneous `Image` objects, which should help with the performance issues you're experiencing.

I seem to have lost the `frameDelay` in the animation loop. 

```tsx
 startAnimationLoop(context: CanvasRenderingContext2D) {
  const image = new Image();
  const loop = (timestamp: number) => {
   if (!this.gameTime) {
    this.gameTime = timestamp; // Initialize gameTime on the first animation frame
   }
   this.gameTime = timestamp; // Update gameTime for the next frame

   // Get the parallax layers for the current level

   const layers = this.state.layers;
   // context.clearRect(0, 0, context.canvas.width, context.canvas.height);
   // Draw the parallax background layers
   context.save();
   layers.forEach(layer => {
    drawParallaxLayer(context, layer, this.state.backgroundOffsetX, this.props.canvasWidth, this.props.canvasHeight, image);
   });
   context.restore();

   if (this.state.isPhraseComplete) {
    this.drawScrollingText(context);
   }
   // Reset globalAlpha if other drawings should not be affected
   context.globalAlpha = 1.0;

   this.updateCharacterAndBackground(context);

   // Save the request ID to be able to cancel it
   this.animationFrameIndex = requestAnimationFrame(loop);
   this.checkProximityAndSetAction();
  };

  // Start the animation loop
  this.animationFrameIndex = requestAnimationFrame(loop);
 }
```

What is the best way to have the loop run only once per 100 milliseconds?

---

**Codeium** _at 8:00 am, Jun 11, 2024_

To adjust your `startAnimationLoop` function so that the loop runs once per 100 milliseconds, you would need to incorporate a `frameDelay` mechanism that keeps track of the time since the last update and only continues with the rest of the function if the delay has been met or exceeded.

Here's a modified version of your `startAnimationLoop` function that includes a `frameDelay`:

```tsx
startAnimationLoop(context: CanvasRenderingContext2D) {
  const frameDelay = 100; // Delay in milliseconds (100ms for 10 FPS)
  let lastFrameTime = 0; // Time at which the last frame was processed

  const loop = (timestamp: number) => {
    if (!this.gameTime) {
      this.gameTime = timestamp; // Initialize gameTime on the first animation frame
      lastFrameTime = timestamp; // Initialize lastFrameTime on the first frame
    }

    // Calculate the time elapsed since the last frame
    const timeElapsed = timestamp - lastFrameTime;

    if (timeElapsed >= frameDelay) {
      // Update lastFrameTime to the current timestamp
      lastFrameTime = timestamp - (timeElapsed % frameDelay);

      // Your drawing and update logic here

      // Clear the canvas and draw the background layers
      context.clearRect(0, 0, context.canvas.width, context.canvas.height);
      context.save();
      this.state.layers.forEach(layer => {
        drawParallaxLayer(context, layer, this.state.backgroundOffsetX, this.props.canvasWidth, this.props.canvasHeight);
      });
      context.restore();

      // Additional drawing logic...
      if (this.state.isPhraseComplete) {
        this.drawScrollingText(context);
      }
      context.globalAlpha = 1.0;

      this.updateCharacterAndBackground(context);
      this.checkProximityAndSetAction();
    }

    // Request the next frame, continuing the loop
    this.animationFrameIndex = requestAnimationFrame(loop);
  };

  // Start the animation loop
  this.animationFrameIndex = requestAnimationFrame(loop);
}
```

In this version, `lastFrameTime` keeps track of when the last frame was processed. On each call to `loop`, the function checks if the `timeElapsed` since the last frame is greater than or equal to `frameDelay`. If so, it proceeds with the drawing and update logic. The modulo operation `(timeElapsed % frameDelay)` is used to adjust `lastFrameTime` to maintain a stable frame rate even if `requestAnimationFrame` calls `loop` more frequently than every 100 milliseconds.

The `requestAnimationFrame` method typically runs at 60 frames per second (approximately every 16.67 milliseconds), so using a `frameDelay` of 100 milliseconds will effectively limit your loop to 10 frames per second.
