In my `XtermAdapter` I call the `xterm/fit-addon` `fit()` function, which says it resized the `xterm` element to the size of the containing element, but it doesn't return any value.

How can I query the size of the containing element from the `HandexTerm` so that I can pass the width down to the `TerminalGame`?

```tsx
    <TerminalGame
     ref={this.terminalGameRef}
     canvasHeight={this.canvasHeight}
     canvasWidth="800"
     isInPhraseMode={this.state.isInPhraseMode}
     heroAction={this.state.heroAction}
     zombie4Action={this.state.zombie4Action}
    />
```

To query the size of the containing element from `HandexTerm`, you can use a `ref` to the container element in the `XtermAdapter` and then access its `clientWidth` and `clientHeight` properties. Since `XtermAdapter` has a `terminalElementRef`, you can utilize that to get the dimensions.

Here's a quick example of how you could get the width and height of the `terminalElement` from `XtermAdapter`:

```tsx
// Inside XtermAdapter class
public getTerminalSize(): { width: number; height: number } | undefined {
  if (this.terminalElementRef.current) {
    return {
      width: this.terminalElementRef.current.clientWidth,
      height: this.terminalElementRef.current.clientHeight,
    };
  }
  return undefined;
}
```

Then, in `HandexTerm`, you can call this method and pass the dimensions to `TerminalGame`:

```tsx
public render() {
  // Assuming you have a method to get the size in XtermAdapter
  const terminalSize = this.adapterRef.current?.getTerminalSize();

  return (
    <>
      <Output
        elements={this.state.outputElements}
        onTouchStart={this.handleTouchStart}
        onTouchEnd={this.handleTouchEnd}
        onTouchMove={this.handleTouchMove}
      />
      <TerminalGame
        ref={this.terminalGameRef}
        canvasHeight={this.canvasHeight}
        canvasWidth={terminalSize ? `${terminalSize.width}px` : "800"} // Use the width from terminalSize if available
        isInPhraseMode={this.state.isInPhraseMode}
        heroAction={this.state.heroAction}
        zombie4Action={this.state.zombie4Action}
      />
      {/* ... other components */}
    </>
  );
}
```

Make sure to call `getTerminalSize()` after the component has mounted and rendered, as the size measurements will be accurate only after the DOM elements have been fully laid out. You might need to trigger a re-render when the terminal size changes, for example, after window resizing or other layout updates.

I am trying this:

```tsx
 componentDidMount(): void {
  this.terminalSize = this.adapterRef.current?.getTerminalSize();
 }
```

But this in the `render():

```tsx
   console.log('HandexTerm render', this.terminalSize);
```

Ouputs this:

```log
HandexTerm render undefined
```

The issue you're encountering is likely because `componentDidMount` is called before the `XtermAdapter` has mounted and rendered, so `this.adapterRef.current` is still `undefined` at the time `getTerminalSize()` is called. To resolve this, you can use a lifecycle method or effect hook that will ensure the `XtermAdapter` has mounted, such as `componentDidUpdate` or a custom method that you call after confirming the component is mounted.

You can try setting the state once the `XtermAdapter` has mounted, which will trigger a re-render and should give you the correct terminal size:

```tsx
componentDidMount(): void {
  // you must check if the component is actually mounted
  if (this.adapterRef.current) {
    const size = this.adapterRef.current.getTerminalSize();
    if (size) {
      this.setState({ terminalSize: size });
    }
  }
}
```

Then, in the `render` method, you can access the size from the state instead of a class property:

```tsx
public render() {
  console.log('HandexTerm render', this.state.terminalSize);
  const terminalSize = this.state.terminalSize;

  return (
    <>
      <Output
        elements={this.state.outputElements}
        onTouchStart={this.handleTouchStart}
        onTouchEnd={this.handleTouchEnd}
        onTouchMove={this.handleTouchMove}
      />
      <TerminalGame
        ref={this.terminalGameRef}
        canvasHeight={this.canvasHeight}
        canvasWidth={terminalSize ? `${terminalSize.width}px` : "800"} // Use the width from state if available
        isInPhraseMode={this.state.isInPhraseMode}
        heroAction={this.state.heroAction}
        zombie4Action={this.state.zombie4Action}
      />
      {/* ... other components */}
    </>
  );
}
```

Remember to add `terminalSize` to the state type definition if you're using TypeScript to avoid type errors.

Also, if the `XtermAdapter` could update its size after certain interactions (like window resizing), you should set up an event listener to update the state accordingly.

It's working now but he canvas renders like this:

```html
<canvas width="[object Object]px" height="100px"></canvas>
```

This issue occurs because `this.state.terminalSize` is an object with `width` and `height` properties, and when you're trying to set the `canvasWidth` prop, it's being stringified incorrectly.

Here's how you can correctly extract the `width` and `height` from `this.state.terminalSize` and apply them to the `canvasWidth` and `canvasHeight` props:

```tsx
public render() {
  const { terminalSize } = this.state;
  const canvasWidth = terminalSize ? `${terminalState.width}px` : "800";
  const canvasHeight = terminalSize ? `${terminalState.height}px` : "100";

  return (
    <>
      {/* ... other components */}
      <TerminalGame
        ref={this.terminalGameRef}
        canvasHeight={canvasHeight}
        canvasWidth={canvasWidth}
        isInPhraseMode={this.state.isInPhraseMode}
        heroAction={this.state.heroAction}
        zombie4Action={this.state.zombie4Action}
      />
      {/* ... other components */}
    </>
  );
}
```

Make sure you are using the correct property names (`width` and `height`) as defined in your `getTerminalSize` method or as they appear in your component's state. If the property names are different, adjust the code to match them.
