If I want to reset the `TerminalGame` from the `HandexTerm` that loads it, what is the proper way to reset it?

```tsx
    <TerminalGame
     ref={this.terminalGameRef}
     canvasHeight={this.canvasHeight}
     canvasWidth={canvasWidth} // Use the width from terminalSize if available
     isInPhraseMode={this.state.isInPhraseMode}
     heroAction={this.state.heroAction}
     zombie4Action={this.state.zombie4Action}
     onTouchStart={this.handleTouchStart}
     onTouchEnd={this.handleTouchEnd}
    />
```

To reset the `TerminalGame` from `HandexTerm`, you can expose a reset method in `TerminalGame` and call it using the `ref` from `HandexTerm`. There's no direct reset method for `TerminalGame` in the provided context, but you can call methods that seem to reset parts of the game state.

You might need to implement a reset method in `TerminalGame` that resets relevant state and stops any ongoing animations. Here's how you could do that:

```tsx
// In TerminalGame.tsx
class TerminalGame extends React.Component<ITerminalGameProps, ITerminalGameState> {
  // ... existing class methods and properties

  public resetGame = (): void => {
    if (this.animationFrameIndex) {
      cancelAnimationFrame(this.animationFrameIndex);
    }
    
    // Reset any other relevant game state here, e.g., positions, actions, timers
    this.setState({
      heroAction: this.props.heroAction,
      heroPosition: { leftX: this.props.canvasWidth * this.heroXPercent, topY: 30 },
      // ... other state properties to reset
    });

    // Possibly call setup methods to reinitialize game state
    this.setupCanvas();
    // If you need to restart the animation loop, do it here
    if (this.state.context) {
      this.startAnimationLoop(this.state.context);
    }
  };

  // ... rest of the class
}
```

Then, from `HandexTerm`, you would call this method using the `ref`:

```tsx
// In HandexTerm.tsx
class HandexTerm extends React.Component {
  private terminalGameRef = React.createRef<TerminalGame>();

  // ... other methods and properties

  private resetTerminalGame = (): void => {
    this.terminalGameRef.current?.resetGame();
  };

  // When you need to reset the game, call this method
}
```

You have to ensure that all the resources used by `TerminalGame`, such as intervals, timeouts, or animation frames, are properly cleared and reset to prevent memory leaks or unexpected behavior.

As a React newb, it seems like I could do something like this:

```tsx
 getInitstate(props: ITerminalGameProps): ITerminalGameState {
  return {
   heroAction: props.heroAction,
   heroPosition: { leftX: props.canvasWidth * this.heroXPercent, topY: 30 },
   heroReady: false,
   zombieAction: props.zombie4Action,
   zombie4Position: { leftX: -50, topY: 0 },
   zombie4Ready: false,
   context: null as CanvasRenderingContext2D | null,
   idleStartTime: null,
   backgroundOffsetX: 0,
  };
 }

 public resetGame(): void {
  this.setState(this.getInitstate(this.props));
 }

 constructor(props: ITerminalGameProps) {
  super(props);
  this.state = this.getInitstate(props);
 }
```

How many Rules of React am I breaking?

**Codeium** _at 8:50 am, Jun 7, 2024_

Your approach for resetting the game state in `TerminalGame` using the `getInitstate` method and calling it from the `resetGame` method is not breaking any fundamental rules of React. It's a common pattern to extract initial state logic into a function to reuse it for resetting state. Here's a summary of what you're doing right:

1. **Reusability**: You're reusing `getInitstate` to set initial state in the constructor and to reset the state later on.
2. **setState**: You're correctly using `setState` to update the component's state.

However, there are a couple of best practices and potential issues to consider:

- **Directly modifying the state**: Ensure that you're not directly modifying the state anywhere in your component. Always use `this.setState()` to update the state.
- **Asynchronous `setState`**: Remember that `setState` is asynchronous. If you need to perform actions after the state has been reset, use the callback form of `setState` or lifecycle methods like `componentDidUpdate`.
- **Animation frames and resources**: If your game involves animation frames, timeouts, or intervals, remember to cancel them before resetting the state to avoid memory leaks or unexpected behavior. This would typically be done in the `resetGame` method or another cleanup method.
- **Derived state from props**: If you're using props to set the initial state, be mindful that if the props change after the component has mounted, the state won't update unless you handle this in `componentDidUpdate` or via a state updater pattern with hooks.

It's good practice to ensure that any event listeners or subscriptions are also cleaned up before resetting the game state. If you have such resources, you should clean them up inside the `componentWillUnmount` method or before setting the new state in `resetGame`.

Overall, your current code seems to follow React's guidelines for managing state, and as long as you handle the cleanup of any ongoing effects or subscriptions, you should be fine. If you find that your game state depends on the previous state or props, make sure to use the functional form of `setState` or handle updates correctly in lifecycle methods or hooks.

Your last bullet item, how would I update these state-derived-from-props values in `componenentDidUpdate`?

```tsx
  return {
   heroAction: props.heroAction,
   heroPosition: { leftX: props.canvasWidth * this.heroXPercent, topY: 30 },
   heroReady: false,
   zombieAction: props.zombie4Action,
   zombie4Position: { leftX: -50, topY: 0 },
   zombie4Ready: false,
   context: null as CanvasRenderingContext2D | null,
   idleStartTime: null,
   backgroundOffsetX: 0,
  };
```

To update state in `componentDidUpdate` when props change, you compare the current props with the previous props and, if necessary, update the state accordingly. Here's an example based on the state you've provided:

```tsx
class TerminalGame extends React.Component<ITerminalGameProps, ITerminalGameState> {
  // ... other methods and properties

  componentDidUpdate(prevProps: ITerminalGameProps) {
    // Check if relevant props have changed
    if (prevProps.heroAction !== this.props.heroAction ||
        prevProps.zombie4Action !== this.props.zombie4Action ||
        prevProps.canvasWidth !== this.props.canvasWidth) {
      // Only update the state if it's necessary
      this.setState({
        heroAction: this.props.heroAction,
        // Recalculate heroPosition based on new canvasWidth
        heroPosition: { leftX: this.props.canvasWidth * this.heroXPercent, topY: 30 },
        zombieAction: this.props.zombie4Action,
        // If the zombie position depends on new props, update it here as well
        // Otherwise, you might not need to update it
        // zombie4Position: { leftX: -50, topY: 0 },
      });
    }
  }

  // ... rest of the class
}
```

In this example, `componentDidUpdate` checks if `heroAction`, `zombie4Action`, or `canvasWidth` props have changed. If they have, it recalculates `heroPosition` and updates the state.

Be careful with setting state in `componentDidUpdate` as it can lead to an infinite loop if not handled properly. Always include condition checks to ensure that you only update the state when the props have actually changed, as shown in the example. Additionally, when you set the state, it should not be based on the current state because that might lead to out-of-sync issues between props and state.

It sounds like, as a React newb, I am making things overly complicated and I shouldn't do that, so I am going to return to your original suggestion about resetting state.

However, it looks like I also may have already made things overly complicated with the overlapping `props` and `state`

I should probably move the state that's entagled with props directly into the props. Is that correct? Would that be better practice within the React best practices?

```tsx
interface ITerminalGameProps {
 canvasHeight: number
 canvasWidth: number
 isInPhraseMode: boolean
 heroAction: ActionType
 zombie4Action: ActionType
 onTouchStart: TouchEventHandler<HTMLDivElement>;
 onTouchEnd: TouchEventHandler<HTMLDivElement>;
}

interface ITerminalGameState {
 heroAction: ActionType;
 heroPosition: SpritePosition;
 heroReady: boolean;
 zombieAction: ActionType;
 zombie4Position: SpritePosition;
 zombie4Ready: boolean;
 context: CanvasRenderingContext2D | null;
 idleStartTime: number | null; // in milliseconds
 backgroundOffsetX: number;
}
```

In React, props are read-only and should be managed by the parent component, whereas state is local and mutable. If `heroAction` and `zombie4Action` are passed as props to `TerminalGame`, you typically wouldn't duplicate these in the component's state. Instead, you would use the props directly in your render method and other methods where you need to access those values.

If `heroPosition` and `zombie4Position` are calculated from `props.canvasWidth` and potentially other props, but also need to change independently within `TerminalGame` (for example, as the game progresses), you might keep these as part of the `TerminalGame`'s state. However, if those positions are entirely determined by props and don't change separately, then they should not be part of the state.

You should move to props any value that:

1. Is passed down from a parent component.
2. Does not change within the component.
3. Is used to compute the state once when the component is initialized.

The `context` is derived from the canvas ref and is more of an internal detail of `TerminalGame`, so it makes sense as part of the state (or as a class property, since it does not need to trigger renders when it changes).

The `idleStartTime` and `backgroundOffsetX` seem to be internal state variables that change due to game logic, so they should remain part of the state.

Here's how you could simplify the `ITerminalGameState` based on these principles:

```tsx
interface ITerminalGameProps {
  canvasHeight: number;
  canvasWidth: number;
  isInPhraseMode: boolean;
  heroAction: ActionType;
  zombie4Action: ActionType;
  onTouchStart: TouchEventHandler<HTMLDivElement>;
  onTouchEnd: TouchEventHandler<HTMLDivElement>;
}

interface ITerminalGameState {
  heroPosition: SpritePosition;
  heroReady: boolean;
  zombie4Position: SpritePosition;
  zombie4Ready: boolean;
  context: CanvasRenderingContext2D | null;
  idleStartTime: number | null; // in milliseconds
  backgroundOffsetX: number;
}

export class TerminalGame extends React.Component<ITerminalGameProps, ITerminalGameState> {
  // Use props.heroAction and props.zombie4Action directly instead of duplicating them in state
  // ...
}
```

In this setup, `heroAction` and `zombie4Action` are accessed from `props` directly, and only the state that should be mutable within `TerminalGame` is kept in `ITerminalGameState`. Remember that moving the state into props only makes sense when the parent component should have control over that piece of data and when the data doesn't need to change within the child component (`TerminalGame` in this case).

Always remember to update the parent state via callbacks (like handle functions) if you need to make changes to these props from the child component. This is part of the "lifting state up" pattern.

That is helpful background information. I am having a current problem where I want to set the `Zombie4Action` to `Death` for three seconds from a function in the `HandexTerm`.

That part is currently working, but at the end of the timout, I want to set the `Zombie4Position.leftX` to -70.

What is the most React-optimal way of handling that? The `Zombie4Postion` is often updated within the `TerminalGame`, so I think from what you're saying, the position should not be passed as a prop, because the `TerminalGame` can't update props that are passed in to it.

---

**Codeium** _at 11:31 am, Jun 7, 2024_

Correct, since `Zombie4Position` is frequently updated within `TerminalGame`, it should be part of the component's state, not props. To handle the scenario you described, you can use a combination of state, props, and a timeout to achieve the desired behavior. Here's an outline of the most React-optimal way to handle it:

1. Define a method in `TerminalGame` to update `Zombie4Position`.
2. Expose a method in `TerminalGame` that can be called from `HandexTerm` to trigger the `Death` action and update the position after three seconds.
3. Use a timeout within this method to delay the state update.

Here's how it can be implemented:

In `TerminalGame.tsx`:

```tsx
export class TerminalGame extends React.Component<ITerminalGameProps, ITerminalGameState> {
  // ... other methods and properties

  public setZombie4ToDeathThenResetPosition = (): void => {
    // Set the zombie action to 'Death'
    this.setZombie4Action('Death');
    
    // After three seconds, reset the position
    setTimeout(() => {
      this.setState(prevState => ({
        zombie4Position: { ...prevState.zombie4Position, leftX: -70 }
      }));
      // Optionally reset the action if needed
      this.setZombie4Action('Idle'); // Or the default action you want to set
    }, 3000);
  };

  // ... rest of the class
}
```

In `HandexTerm.tsx`:

```tsx
class HandexTerm extends React.Component {
  private terminalGameRef = React.createRef<TerminalGame>();

  // ... other methods

  private handleZombieDeath = (): void => {
    this.terminalGameRef.current?.setZombie4ToDeathThenResetPosition();
  };

  // Call handleZombieDeath where you need to trigger the zombie death
}
```

This approach encapsulates the logic for handling the death action within `TerminalGame`, which is responsible for its own state. It also provides a clear interface for `HandexTerm` to trigger the action without directly manipulating the state of its child.

Remember to clear any pending timeouts if the component unmounts to avoid potential issues like trying to update the state of an unmounted component:

```tsx
export class TerminalGame extends React.Component<ITerminalGameProps, ITerminalGameState> {
  private deathTimeout?: NodeJS.Timeout;

  componentWillUnmount() {
    if (this.deathTimeout) {
      clearTimeout(this.deathTimeout);
    }
  }

  public setZombie4ToDeathThenResetPosition = (): void => {
    // ... same as above

    this.deathTimeout = setTimeout(() => {
      // ... same as above
    }, 3000);
  };

  // ... rest of the class
}
```

This setup should be in line with React best practices for managing state and inter-component communication.

The new death-timeout feature seems to be working, but the sprite is no longer changing.

I can set a breakpoint and see that this code is running both when I set the action to `Death` and when it gets reset by the timeout to `Walk`.

```tsx
 public setCurrentActionType(newActionType: ActionType) {
  if(this.currentActionType === newActionType) return
  // Update the current action
  this.currentActionType = newActionType;
  this.frameIndex = 0
  // Update the current sprite to match the new action
  this.sprite = this.sprites[newActionType];
 }
```

This had baen working recently for the Zombie, and it is still working for the Hero when I set it to `Run`

What are the best says to troubleshoot this?

I am going to put a console.log to show the sprite that is selected.

---

**Codeium** _at 12:46 pm, Jun 7, 2024_

Troubleshooting this issue involves verifying various parts of your code to ensure that the state and props are being updated correctly and that the rendering logic is responding to these updates as expected. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot the problem:

1. **Logging**: You've mentioned adding `console.log` statements to show the sprite that is selected. This is a good first step. Make sure you log not only the selected sprite but also the `newActionType` passed to `setCurrentActionType`.

2. **Check for State Updates**: Verify that the `setCurrentActionType` method is actually being called when the action type changes. You should also check if any other part of your code could be overriding the `currentActionType` after you set it.

3. **Check Render Method**: In your `TerminalGame` component's render method, ensure that the sprite being rendered is based on the `currentActionType`. If you have conditional rendering based on the state or props, make sure those conditions are correct.

4. **Props and State Sync**: Make sure that the props being passed down to `TerminalGame` from `HandexTerm` are correct and that they trigger the necessary updates in `TerminalGame`. If `setCurrentActionType` relies on props, ensure that they are being updated as expected.

5. **React DevTools**: Use React DevTools to inspect the props and state of the `TerminalGame` component in real-time. This can help you determine if the state is what you expect it to be at any point in time.

6. **Sprite Rendering Logic**: Investigate the logic that uses `this.sprite` to render the sprite on the canvas. Ensure that the rendering logic is being called after `this.sprite` is updated.

7. **Component Updates**: Check if the component where `setCurrentActionType` is defined is re-rendering appropriately after state changes. If it is a PureComponent or shouldComponentUpdate is implemented, it might prevent re-renders if not set up correctly.

8. **Animation Loop**: If your game uses an animation loop, make sure that the loop is running and that it's using the latest state for rendering.

Here's an example of what your logging might look like:

```tsx
public setCurrentActionType(newActionType: ActionType) {
  if(this.currentActionType === newActionType) return;
  console.log(`Changing action from ${this.currentActionType} to ${newActionType}`);
  // Update the current action
  this.currentActionType = newActionType;
  this.frameIndex = 0;
  // Update the current sprite to match the new action
  this.sprite = this.sprites[newActionType];
  console.log(`New sprite selected:`, this.sprite);
}
```

If after these steps you're still having issues, you may want to check for more subtle bugs, like typos in action types or issues with sprite asset loading. If the sprite assets are loaded asynchronously, make sure they're fully loaded before you try to render them.

**User** _at 1:18 pm, Jun 7, 2024_

The problem seems to have something to do with this in the `CharacterActionFC.tsx`

```tsx
export const CharacterActionFC: React.FC<ICharacterActionComponentProps> = (
 props: ICharacterActionComponentProps
) => {
 // Start or restart the animation when the action type changes
 // In CharacterActionComponent.tsx
 useEffect(() => {
  // Set the current action type
  if(props.name === 'Hero') props.baseCharacter.setCurrentActionType(props.currentActionType);

  // Start the animation loop and handle position updates
  props.baseCharacter.updatePositionAndAnimate(props.onPositionChange, props.canvasWidth, props.isInScrollMode);

  // Specify how to clean up after this effect
  return () => {
   props.baseCharacter.stopAnimation();
  };
 }, [props.currentActionType, props.baseCharacter, props.onPositionChange]);

 return null;
```

If the line with `setCurrentActionType` is only run for `hero`, then it works, otherwise the Zombie `Death` is immediately overwritten by `Walk`. But if I don't run that line for `hero`, then I can't update the `hero` action.

---

**Codeium** _at 1:19 pm, Jun 7, 2024_

Given the conditional logic within your `useEffect` that only calls `setCurrentActionType` for the `Hero`, it appears that the `Zombie4` action is not being managed in the same way. If the `Zombie4` action is being reset to `Walk` immediately after `Death`, it suggests there may be a competing state update that is overwriting `Death` with `Walk`.

To address this issue, you should ensure that `setCurrentActionType` is called for `Zombie4` when appropriate, and prevent any other parts of your code from incorrectly resetting the `Zombie4` action. Here's an approach you can take:

1. Remove the `Hero` check in `CharacterActionFC` and apply `setCurrentActionType` for any character. Modify the `useEffect` to manage both `Hero` and `Zombie4` actions:

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  // Set the current action type for any character, not just 'Hero'
  props.baseCharacter.setCurrentActionType(props.currentActionType);

  // Start the animation loop and handle position updates
  props.baseCharacter.updatePositionAndAnimate(props.onPositionChange, props.canvasWidth, props.isInScrollMode);

  // Specify how to clean up after this effect
  return () => {
    props.baseCharacter.stopAnimation();
  };
}, [props.currentActionType, props.baseCharacter, props.onPositionChange]);
```

2. Ensure that the `Zombie4`'s `Death` action is not being overridden by another update elsewhere in your code. You may need to track down where the `Zombie4` action is being set to `Walk` and add appropriate conditions to prevent this from happening immediately after `Death`.

3. If the `Zombie4` action is meant to be temporary (like `Death` for 3 seconds), you should manage this within the component that controls the `Zombie4` state, which might be `TerminalGame`. After the `Death` action is triggered, use a timeout to delay the change back to `Walk`, but ensure that this timeout is cleared if the component unmounts or if a new action is set before the timeout completes.

4. If the `Zombie4`'s action is controlled by parent component state, ensure that the parent component (`HandexTerm` in your case) provides the correct action to `TerminalGame`, and subsequently to `CharacterActionFC`, reflecting the `Death` action and later the transition back to `Walk`.

Remember to check any other effects or component lifecycle methods in both `CharacterActionFC` and `TerminalGame` to ensure they're not inadvertently causing the `Zombie4` action to reset prematurely. If there is a complex interaction between props and state for managing actions, consider refactoring to simplify the flow and make the source of truth for the action state clear.
