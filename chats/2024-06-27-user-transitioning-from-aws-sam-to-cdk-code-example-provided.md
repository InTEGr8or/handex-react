summary: The user sought help in transitioning from an AWS SAM application template to an AWS CDK deployment strategy. They were provided with a TypeScript CDK example to replace their SAM template, focusing on Cognito authentication, S3 resources, IAM roles, and a Lambda@Edge function. To resolve issues during the CDK initialization process, they were advised to either create a new subdirectory for CDK in their project or integrate CDK into the existing project. Additionally, they encountered TypeScript errors related to missing module declarations for AWS CDK packages, which were addressed by installing the necessary packages and resolving API changes in the project.

You helped me create a SAM application that builds out some authentication resouces in my AWS account that I can use with my Vite Yarn React TUI app.

We were having some dificulty getting this SAM template to work:

We were having trouble applying the bucket policy to the bucket so that my TUI app can save user logs to S3 in such a way that each users log is partitioned and visible only to that user.

The template includes a Lambda@Edge function that creates HttpOnly Cookies for added security.

Since the SAM app is not working as smoothly as I expected, I would like your help using a CDK deployment strategy instead. This is just for the AWS server components that provide Cognito authentication so that the app can store user logs in the bucket that's created in the template.

Can you help me do that?

Transitioning from AWS SAM to AWS CDK involves a paradigm shift from defining resources in YAML to defining them programmatically in a supported programming language such as TypeScript, Python, Java, or C#. Since you're working on a Vite Yarn React TypeScript project, I'll assume TypeScript for the CDK example.

Below, I outline the CDK equivalent of your SAM template, focusing on the key components: Cognito User Pool, Identity Pool, S3 Bucket, Bucket Policy, IAM Role, and the Lambda@Edge function. This example assumes you have basic knowledge of CDK and have the CDK library installed. If not, you might need to first install the AWS CDK Toolkit from npm (`npm install -g aws-cdk`) and initialize a new CDK project (`cdk init app --language=typescript`).

```typescript
import * as cdk from '@aws-cdk/core';
import * as cognito from '@aws-cdk/aws-cognito';
import * as s3 from '@aws-cdk/aws-s3';
import * as iam from '@aws-cdk/aws-iam';
import * as lambda from '@aws-cdk/aws-lambda';
import * as s3deploy from '@aws-cdk/aws-s3-deployment';

class HandTermAppStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    // Cognito User Pool
    const userPool = new cognito.UserPool(this, 'HandTermUserPool', {
      userPoolName: 'HandTermUserPool',
      selfSignUpEnabled: true,
      userVerification: {
        emailSubject: 'Verify your email for our app!',
        emailBody: 'Hello {username}, Thanks for signing up to our app! Your verification code is {####}',
        emailStyle: cognito.VerificationEmailStyle.CODE,
      },
      signInAliases: {
        email: true
      },
      passwordPolicy: {
        minLength: 8,
        requireUppercase: true,
        requireLowercase: true,
        requireDigits: true,
        requireSymbols: true,
      },
      autoVerify: { email: true }
    });

    // Cognito User Pool Client
    const userPoolClient = userPool.addClient('AppClient', {
      authFlows: {
        userSrp: true,
        refreshToken: true,
      },
      generateSecret: false,
    });

    // Cognito Identity Pool
    const identityPool = new cognito.CfnIdentityPool(this, 'HandTermIdentityPool', {
      identityPoolName: 'HandTermIdentityPool',
      allowUnauthenticatedIdentities: false,
      cognitoIdentityProviders: [{
        clientId: userPoolClient.userPoolClientId,
        providerName: userPool.userPoolProviderName,
      }],
    });

    // S3 Bucket for User Logs
    const logsBucket = new s3.Bucket(this, 'HandTermHistoryBucket', {
      bucketName: 'handterm-history',
      blockPublicAccess: s3.BlockPublicAccess.BLOCK_ALL,
      encryption: s3.BucketEncryption.S3_MANAGED,
    });

    // Lambda Execution Role
    const lambdaExecutionRole = new iam.Role(this, 'LambdaExecutionRole', {
      assumedBy: new iam.CompositePrincipal(
        new iam.ServicePrincipal('lambda.amazonaws.com'),
        new iam.ServicePrincipal('edgelambda.amazonaws.com')
      ),
      managedPolicies: [
        iam.ManagedPolicy.fromAwsManagedPolicyName('service-role/AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole'),
        iam.ManagedPolicy.fromAwsManagedPolicyName('AmazonS3FullAccess'),
      ],
    });

    // Lambda@Edge Function for HttpOnly Cookies
    const lambdaAtEdge = new lambda.Function(this, 'LambdaAtEdgeFunction', {
      runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_14_X,
      handler: 'index.handler',
      code: lambda.Code.fromAsset('path/to/lambda/code'), // Adjust path as necessary
      role: lambdaExecutionRole,
      memorySize: 128,
      description: 'A Lambda@Edge function for HttpOnly Cookies',
    });

    // Outputs
    new cdk.CfnOutput(this, 'UserPoolId', { value: userPool.userPoolId });
    new cdk.CfnOutput(this, 'UserPoolClientId', { value: userPoolClient.userPoolClientId });
    new cdk.CfnOutput(this, 'IdentityPoolId', { value: identityPool.ref });
    new cdk.CfnOutput(this, 'BucketName', { value: logsBucket.bucketName });
  }
}

const app = new cdk.App();
new HandTermAppStack(app, 'HandTermAppStack');
```

This is a foundational example to get you started. Note the following:
- You might need to adjust paths, names, and certain configurations to fit your exact requirements.
- Lambda@Edge functions have specific deployment considerations, especially regarding the region they're deployed in

When I run this in the app:

```powershell
🕐[21:12:34]❯ cdk init app --language=typescript

`cdk init` cannot be run in a non-empty directory!
```

I get that error.

Is there a way to `init` it in the same directory or should I use a subdirectory?

**Codeium** _at 9:15 pm, Jun 27, 2024_

The error message you're encountering suggests you're trying to initialize a new AWS CDK project in a directory that already contains files. The `cdk init` command requires the target directory to be empty to prevent accidental overwriting of existing files. 

Given that you're working in a directory already used for your project, you have a couple of options:

### Option 1: Initialize CDK in a Subdirectory
You can create a new subdirectory within your project specifically for the CDK infrastructure code. This keeps your infrastructure code separate from your application code, which is a good practice for project organization and version control.

1. Create a new directory for the CDK project:
```powershell
mkdir cdk
```
2. Change into the new directory:
```powershell
cd cdk
```
3. Run the `cdk init` command within this new directory:
```powershell
cdk init app --language=typescript
```

This approach lets you maintain a single repository for both your application code and infrastructure code, without mixing the two directly. You can navigate into the `cdk` directory whenever you need to work on the infrastructure.

### Option 2: Integrate CDK into the Existing Project
If you prefer to integrate CDK directly into your existing project without creating a subdirectory, you'll need to manually set up the CDK. This involves:

1. Installing the necessary CDK packages:
```powershell
npm install aws-cdk @aws-cdk/core
```
2. Manually creating the files you need for CDK, such as `cdk.json`, `tsconfig.json`, and the TypeScript files for defining your CDK stack. You can look at the structure generated by the `cdk init` command in a separate, temporary directory to get an idea of what files are typically created and their contents.

3. Manually setting up the `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript configuration, ensuring it's compatible with both your application and CDK.

4. Writing your CDK stack in TypeScript files as needed.

Option 1 is generally simpler and keeps your infrastructure code cleanly separated from your application code. It's the recommended approach unless you have specific reasons for needing to keep everything in the same directory.

I chose option 1, the subdirectory.

The init process created a `package-lock.json` so I guess that kind of means I should use `npm` instead of `yarn` to install, but that gives me some errors:

**Codeium** _at 9:27 pm, Jun 27, 2024_

The errors you're encountering indicate that TypeScript cannot find the type declarations for the AWS CDK modules you're trying to import. This usually happens because the necessary NPM packages haven't been installed in your project.

Since the `cdk init` command generated a `package-lock.json`, it implies that NPM was used for initial package installation. However, whether you use NPM or Yarn for package management is up to you, as long as you're consistent within the same part of your project to avoid conflicts. 

Given you've encountered errors after running `npm run build`, here's a step you can take to ensure all necessary AWS CDK packages are installed:

### Step 1: Install AWS CDK Packages

You need to explicitly install the AWS CDK libraries that your project depends on. Based on the imports in your `cdk-stack.ts` file, you should install the following packages:

```powershell
npm install @aws-cdk/core @aws-cdk/aws-cognito @aws-cdk/aws-s3 @aws-cdk/aws-iam @aws-cdk/aws-lambda @aws-cdk/aws-s3-deployment
```

Make sure you run this command inside your CDK subdirectory where the `package.json` file is located.

### Optional: Switching to Yarn

If you prefer to use Yarn in line with the rest of your project, you first need to ensure that you remove the `package-lock.json` file (to avoid conflicts between lock files) and then use Yarn to install the dependencies. Here's how you can switch to using Yarn:

1. Delete the `package-lock.json` file in your CDK subdirectory.
2. Delete the `node_modules` directory to remove any previously installed packages via NPM.
3. Run `yarn` to generate a `yarn.lock` file and install the dependencies listed in `package.json`.
4. Install the AWS CDK packages using Yarn:

```powershell
yarn add @aws-cdk/core @aws-cdk/aws-cognito @aws-cdk/aws-s3 @aws-cdk/aws-iam @aws-cdk/aws-lambda @aws-cdk/aws-s3-deployment
```

### Step 2: Build Your Project

After installing the necessary packages, try to build your project again with either:

```powershell
npm run build
```
or, if you switched to Yarn:

```powershell
yarn build
```

This should resolve the TypeScript errors related to missing module declarations.

**User** _at 9:30 pm, Jun 27, 2024_

I haven't switched to yarn yet, but I might do that to be consistent with the parent app.

Currently I get this:

```powershell
🕐[21:29:06]❯ npm run build

**Codeium** _at 9:31 pm, Jun 27, 2024_

The errors you're seeing are related to changes in the AWS CDK API, which can occur as the CDK evolves. Let's address them one by one:

### Error 1: Argument of type 'App' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Construct'.

This error suggests a mismatch between the expected type of the `App` object and what's being passed. In recent versions of the AWS CDK, the `App` class is not considered a `Construct`. If you're following an older guide or example, this might lead to confusion. The correct usage does not require `App` to be treated as a `Construct`:

```typescript
// In bin/cdk.ts or equivalent entry point file
const app = new cdk.App();
new HandTermCdkStack(app, 'HandTermCdkStack');
```

Ensure you're using the correct constructor signature for your stack. The above code snippet is the standard way to initialize a stack in the AWS CDK as of the latest versions.

### Error 2: Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'refreshToken' does not exist in type 'AuthFlow'.

This error is likely due to a typo or a misunderstanding of the property name within the `AuthFlow` configuration of a Cognito User Pool Client. The correct property for enabling refresh token-based authentication is `allowRefreshTokenAuth`, not `refreshToken`. Additionally, make sure you're using the correct structure for specifying authentication flows:

```typescript
// In lib/cdk-stack.ts or where you define the Cognito User Pool Client
const userPoolClient = userPool.addClient('AppClient', {
  authFlows: {
    userSrp: true,
    allowRefreshTokenAuth: true, // Correct property name
  },
  // other properties...
});
```

### General Advice:

- Ensure you're using compatible versions of AWS CDK packages. If your project's `package.json` includes specific versions of AWS CDK libraries, verify they are up to date or compatible with each other. Sometimes, breaking changes or deprecations can lead to such errors.
  
- After making these changes, run `npm install` again to ensure all dependencies are correctly installed according to your `package.json` file, then attempt to build again.

### Regarding Switching to Yarn:

If you decide to switch to Yarn to maintain consistency with your parent app:
1. Delete `package-lock.json` and `node_modules/` in the CDK directory.
2. Run `yarn` to install dependencies and create a `yarn.lock` file.
3. Use `yarn add` for any additional packages you need to install, and use `yarn build` to build your project.

Switching to Yarn should not affect the resolution of these specific TypeScript errors, but it's a good step for maintaining consistency in build processes across your project.

The error you're encountering is due to a mismatch between the `@aws-cdk/core` package and the newer `aws-cdk-lib`. This confusion arises from the significant changes introduced in AWS CDK v2, which aimed to simplify the import process and package management by consolidating most AWS CDK libraries into a single `aws-cdk-lib` package.

Given the contents of your `package.json`, it looks like you're trying to use both the old individual package style (`@aws-cdk/aws-cognito`, `@aws-cdk/aws-iam`, etc.) and the new consolidated `aws-cdk-lib`. This is not the correct approach for CDK v2. In CDK v2, you should only use `aws-cdk-lib` for importing CDK constructs.

Here's how you can resolve the issue:

### Step 1: Update Your Imports

First, update your `cdk-stack.ts` (and any other TypeScript files using CDK imports) to use `aws-cdk-lib` instead of individual packages like `@aws-cdk/core`. Here's an example of how to adjust the imports in your `cdk-stack.ts`:

```typescript
import { aws_cognito as cognito, aws_s3 as s3, aws_iam as iam, aws_lambda as lambda, aws_s3_deployment as s3deploy } from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
```

### Step 2: Clean Up `package.json`

Remove the individual CDK package dependencies (`@aws-cdk/aws-cognito`, `@aws-cdk/aws-iam`, etc.) and `@aws-cdk/core` from your `package.json`, since `aws-cdk-lib` and `constructs` are the only CDK dependencies needed for CDK v2.

Your `dependencies` in `package.json` should look something like this:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "aws-cdk-lib": "2.147.2",
  "constructs": "^10.0.0",
  "source-map-support": "^0.5.21"
}
```

Make sure to run `yarn install` or `npm install` after making changes to your `package.json` to update your `node_modules`.

### Step 3: Update Your CDK Stack Definition

Adjust the `HandTermCdkStack` constructor to extend `Construct` instead of `cdk.App`:

```typescript
export class HandTermCdkStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    // Your stack definition...
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Update the CDK App Initialization

In your entry point file (usually something like `bin/cdk.ts`), make sure you are correctly initializing the app and stack without trying to pass `App` as a `Construct`:

```typescript
import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import { HandTermCdkStack } from '../lib/cdk-stack';

const app = new cdk.App();
new HandTermCdkStack(app, 'HandTermCdkStack');
```

Following these steps should resolve the error and allow your CDK project to build successfully.

Ok, now `yarn build` is successful. 

What are my next steps for testing this out and continuing with what's incomplete?

Great to hear that your build is successful! Now that your AWS CDK stack is set up, the next steps involve deploying your stack to AWS, testing it to ensure it works as expected, and then iterating on your design. Here's how you can proceed:

### 1. Bootstrap your AWS environment (if you haven't already)

AWS CDK requires a bootstrap stack to be deployed in your AWS account, which sets up resources that the CDK CLI uses to deploy your app. Run the following command if you haven't bootstrapped your environment yet:

```shell
cdk bootstrap
```

Ensure your AWS CLI is configured with the correct credentials and default region.

### 2. Deploy the Stack

With your CDK stack defined and built, you can now deploy it to your AWS account:

```shell
cdk deploy
```

This command initiates the deployment process, which includes synthesizing a CloudFormation template from your CDK code, and then deploying that template as a stack in your AWS account.

### 3. Test Your Stack

After deployment, test the functionalities you've set up to ensure they work as expected:

- **Cognito User Pool and Client**: Try signing up a user or using the AWS Management Console to navigate to the Cognito service and see if your user pool looks correct.
- **S3 Bucket**: Check that the S3 bucket for user logs exists and is configured according to your specifications.
- **Lambda@Edge Function**: Depending on how this function is triggered, you may need to configure a CloudFront distribution and test the behavior of the Lambda function when CloudFront requests are made.
- **Identity Pool**: Ensure that the identity pool is correctly set up to federate identities for authenticated and (if configured) unauthenticated users.

### 4. Iterate on Your Application

Based on your testing results, you might need to make changes to your CDK stack. You can update your CDK code and redeploy using `cdk deploy`. The CDK CLI will handle the changesets and update your stack accordingly.

### 5. Cleanup

If you're done testing or if you want to remove the resources to avoid incurring charges, you can destroy the deployed stack:

```shell
cdk destroy
```

This command will remove the resources specified in your CDK stack from your AWS account.

### 6. Version Control

Remember to commit your changes to your version control system to keep track of your infrastructure as code evolution.

### 7. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

Consider setting up CI/CD for your infrastructure and application. This can involve automating the build and deployment process using AWS CodePipeline, GitHub Actions, or other CI/CD tools.

### 8. Documentation

Finally, ensure that your project documentation is updated to reflect the addition of AWS CDK for infrastructure management, including any setup instructions or important notes about the infrastructure.

By following these steps, you should be able to effectively test, deploy, and manage your infrastructure using the AWS CDK.

When I ran `cdk bootstrap` I realized I hadn't added my lambda function code:

```ts
// cdk/lib/app.ts

import { APIGatewayProxyEvent, APIGatewayProxyResult } from 'aws-lambda';


/**
 *
 * Event doc: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/set-up-lambda-proxy-integrations.html#api-gateway-simple-proxy-for-lambda-input-format
 * @param {Object} event - API Gateway Lambda Proxy Input Format
 *
 * Return doc: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/set-up-lambda-proxy-integrations.html
 * @returns {Object} object - API Gateway Lambda Proxy Output Format
 *
 */

import { CloudFrontResponseEvent, CloudFrontResponseHandler, CloudFrontResponseResult } from 'aws-lambda';

export const lambdaHandler: CloudFrontResponseHandler = async (event: CloudFrontResponseEvent): Promise<CloudFrontResponseResult> => {
 const response = event.Records[0].cf.response;
 const headers = response.headers;

 // Set HttpOnly Cookie
 headers['set-cookie'] = [{
  key: 'Set-Cookie',
  value: `handterm-history=YourCookieValue; Path=/; Secure; HttpOnly;`
 }];

 return response;
};

So now I've updated the `cdk/lib/cdk-stack.ts` with this:

```ts
  // Lambda@Edge Function for HttpOnly Cookies
  const lambdaAtEdge = new lambda.Function(this, 'LambdaAtEdgeFunction', {
   runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_20_X,
   handler: 'CloudFrontResponseHandler',
   code: lambda.Code.fromAsset('app.ts'), // Adjust path as necessary
   role: lambdaExecutionRole,
   memorySize: 128,
   description: 'A Lambda@Edge function for HttpOnly Cookies',
  });
```

To successfully include and deploy your Lambda function code using AWS CDK, there are a few adjustments and considerations you need to take into account:

1. **Lambda Function Code Location**: The `lambda.Code.fromAsset('app.ts')` statement indicates that CDK should package the `app.ts` file as the source code for your Lambda function. However, AWS Lambda expects either a zip file containing your code or a directory that it will zip and upload. If `app.ts` is a single TypeScript file, you need to ensure it's transpiled to JavaScript, as AWS Lambda does not natively execute TypeScript code. Typically, you would place your Lambda function code in a specific directory, like `lambda/`, and include any necessary dependencies.

2. **Handler Setting**: The `handler` property should specify the file and method where your Lambda function's handler is defined. If your transpiled JavaScript file is named `app.js` and your export is named `lambdaHandler`, then your handler string should be `app.lambdaHandler`.

3. **Transpiling TypeScript**: If your Lambda function is written in TypeScript, you need to transpile it to JavaScript before deployment. This can be done by setting up a build script in your `package.json` that runs `tsc` or another build tool to transpile your TypeScript code to JavaScript.

4. **Adjusting the CDK Stack for Lambda@Edge**: Lambda@Edge functions have specific requirements, such as being deployed in the `us-east-1` region and having a role that grants permission to execute the function from CloudFront. Ensure that your `lambdaExecutionRole` has the correct permissions for Lambda@Edge.

Considering these points, here's how you might adjust your setup:

### Directory Structure
Create a directory for your Lambda function code, if you haven't already. For example, `lambda/handtermEdgeFunction/`:

```
project-root/
├─ lib/
│  ├─ cdk-stack.ts
├─ lambda/
│  ├─ handtermEdgeFunction/
│  │  ├─ app.ts (or app.js if you've transpiled it)
```

### Transpile TypeScript to JavaScript
If `app.ts` is TypeScript, ensure it's transpiled to JavaScript. Your `package.json` might include a script like:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build-lambda": "tsc --project lambda/handtermEdgeFunction/tsconfig.json"
}
```

You would also need a `tsconfig.json` in your `lambda/handtermEdgeFunction/` directory tailored to your project's needs.

### Update CDK Stack for Lambda@Edge
Adjust your Lambda@Edge function definition in `cdk-stack.ts` to point to the correct directory and handler:

```typescript
const lambdaAtEdge = new lambda.Function(this, 'LambdaAtEdgeFunction', {
  runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_14_X, // Note: Ensure you're using a runtime supported by Lambda@Edge
  handler: 'app.lambdaHandler', // Adjusted to point to the transpiled JS file and handler
  code: lambda.Code.fromAsset('lambda/handtermEdgeFunction/'), // Pointing to the directory
  role: lambdaExecutionRole,
  memorySize: 128,
  description: 'A Lambda@Edge function for HttpOnly Cookies',
});
```

### Deploy
After making these adjustments, run your build scripts and then `cdk deploy` again to deploy your changes.

This setup ensures that your TypeScript Lambda function is correctly packaged and deployed as part of your CDK stack.

For a `tsconfig.json` specifically tailored to a Lambda function, especially if it's located in a subdirectory like `cdk/lambda/handtermEdgeFunction/`, you can start with a simplified version of your main `tsconfig.json` file. The key adjustments would involve targeting settings appropriate for the AWS Lambda execution environment and excluding any unnecessary options that are more relevant to the broader project context.

AWS Lambda currently supports Node.js environments up to Node.js 14.x and recently added support for Node.js 16.x. Ensure your TypeScript configuration targets an appropriate ECMAScript version supported by your chosen runtime. For Node.js 14.x, targeting ES2020 is suitable.

Here's an example `tsconfig.json` for your Lambda function:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2020",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "lib": ["es2020"],
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "rootDir": "./",
    "strict": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "strictNullChecks": true,
    "noImplicitThis": true,
    "alwaysStrict": true,
    "noUnusedLocals": true,
    "noUnusedParameters": true,
    "noImplicitReturns": true,
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,
    "inlineSourceMap": false,
    "inlineSources": false,
    // Optional: Consider enabling these options for stricter type checking
    // "strictPropertyInitialization": true,
    // "strictFunctionTypes": true,
    "experimentalDecorators": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true
  },
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "dist"]
}
```

### Key Points:

- **`target` and `module`**: These settings ensure compatibility with the Lambda execution environment. Adjust the `target` as necessary based on the Node.js version you're using.
- **`lib`**: Specifies a list of library files to be included in the compilation. `es2020` is suitable for Node.js 14.x environments.
- **`outDir` and `rootDir`**: Directs the TypeScript compiler on where to find source files (`rootDir`) and where to output the compiled JavaScript files (`outDir`). Adjust these paths as necessary.
- **`strict`**: Enables a wide range of type checking behavior that results in more robust code.
- **Exclusions**: Includes `node_modules` to avoid compiling dependencies and `dist` (or your specified output directory) to avoid recursive compilation.

### Adjust for Your Environment:

- Modify the paths in `outDir` and `rootDir` if your project structure differs.
- Depending on the Node.js runtime version (`runtime` in your `cdk-stack.ts`), you might adjust the `target` and `lib` to match supported ECMAScript features.

After setting up your `tsconfig.json`, you'll need to ensure your build process compiles the TypeScript code into JavaScript before deploying with CDK. You might have a build script in your main `package.json` that specifically handles this, such as `"build-lambda": "tsc --project lambda/handtermEdgeFunction/tsconfig.json"`, ensuring your Lambda function code is ready for deployment.

I think we have to use Node 16. I am getting linting errors with Node 14.

---

**Codeium** _at 11:14 pm, Jun 27, 2024_

If you need to target Node.js 16 for your AWS Lambda function due to compatibility or feature requirements, you should adjust the TypeScript configuration to align with the capabilities of Node.js 16. This involves modifying the `target` and `lib` compiler options in your `tsconfig.json` to ensure the generated JavaScript code is appropriate for the Node.js 16 runtime environment.

Here's an updated version of the `tsconfig.json` for your Lambda function, located in `cdk/lambda/handtermEdgeFunction/`, to target Node.js 16:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2021", // Node.js 16 supports ES2021 features
    "module": "commonjs",
    "lib": ["es2021"], // Include standard library features for ES2021
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "rootDir": "./",
    "strict": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "strictNullChecks": true,
    "noImplicitThis": true,
    "alwaysStrict": true,
    "noUnusedLocals": true,
    "noUnusedParameters": true,
    "noImplicitReturns": true,
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,
    "inlineSourceMap": false,
    "inlineSources": false,
    "experimentalDecorators": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true // Optionally, skip type checking of declaration files.
  },
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "dist"]
}
```

### Key Adjustments for Node.js 16:

- **`target` and `lib`**: Updated to `ES2021` to leverage the latest ECMAScript features supported by Node.js 16.
- **`skipLibCheck`**: This optional flag can improve build times and sidestep issues with type definitions in your `node_modules`. It's particularly useful if you're encountering linting or type errors from third-party libraries.

After updating your `tsconfig.json`, ensure your Lambda function's code uses features supported by Node.js 16, and adjust your Lambda runtime accordingly in your CDK stack definition:

```typescript
const lambdaAtEdge = new lambda.Function(this, 'LambdaAtEdgeFunction', {
  runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_16_X, // Specify Node.js 16.x runtime
  handler: 'app.lambdaHandler',
  code: lambda.Code.fromAsset('lambda/handtermEdgeFunction/dist'), // Ensure this points to the transpiled JS files
  role: lambdaExecutionRole,
  memorySize: 128,
  description: 'A Lambda@Edge function for HttpOnly Cookies',
});
```

Make sure to compile your TypeScript code and deploy your changes. Adjusting these settings ensures that your Lambda function utilizes the Node.js 16 runtime, aligning with your project requirements and resolving compatibility issues.

The output you've shared indicates that the `cdk bootstrap` command has successfully bootstrapped your AWS environment. This process sets up the necessary resources that the AWS CDK requires to deploy and manage your cloud resources. Here's a quick overview of what happened based on the output:

1. **CloudFormation Stack Deployment**: The CDK Toolkit deployed a CloudFormation stack named `CDKToolkit`. This stack contains the foundational resources needed for CDK deployments, including an S3 bucket for staging assets, IAM roles for deployment and asset publishing, and an ECR repository for container assets.

2. **Resources Created**:
   - **S3 Bucket (`StagingBucket`)**: Used to store assets like Lambda code zips or Docker images that are part of your CDK applications before they are deployed to their final locations.
   - **IAM Roles**: Several roles were created for different purposes:
     - `FilePublishingRole` and `ImagePublishingRole` are used for publishing assets to the S3 bucket and ECR repository.
     - `CloudFormationExecutionRole` is assumed by CloudFormation to deploy resources as defined in your CDK applications.
     - `LookupRole` is used by the CDK CLI to perform environment lookups.
     - `DeploymentActionRole` is used during deployment actions.
   - **ECR Repository (`ContainerAssetsRepository`)**: If your application includes Docker containers, this repository is used to store those container images.
   - **Policies**: Attached to the respective roles, providing the necessary permissions for each role's intended actions.

3. **Successful Bootstrap**: The final line, `✅ Environment aws://865664998993/us-west-1 bootstrapped.`, confirms that the bootstrap process completed successfully for your specified AWS account and region (`us-west-1`).

### Next Steps

With your environment bootstrapped, you're ready to proceed with deploying your CDK application:

- **Deploy Your Application**: Run `cdk deploy` to deploy your CDK stacks to AWS. This command synthesizes your CDK code into an AWS CloudFormation template and deploys it.
- **Testing and Validation**: After deployment, validate the resources created by your CDK application in the AWS Management Console or using the AWS CLI. This might include testing your Lambda@Edge function by triggering it via a CloudFront distribution, verifying Cognito User Pools, etc.
- **Iterate as Needed**: Based on your testing results, you may need to make adjustments to your CDK code and redeploy.

Remember, each time you make changes to your CDK application and want those changes reflected in AWS, you'll need to run `cdk deploy` again. If you're experimenting or learning, keep an eye on the resources being created to avoid unexpected charges.

The error you're encountering indicates that the CDK bootstrap process attempted to create an S3 bucket with a name that already exists in your AWS account and region. S3 bucket names are globally unique, and once a bucket name is taken, it cannot be used by another AWS account or in another region. This name collision is the reason for the failure of the bootstrap process.

The specific error message is:
```
Resource handler returned message: "cdk-hnb659fds-assets-318364255844-us-west-2 already exists (Service: S3, Status Code: 0, Request ID: null)" (RequestToken: 9cd1b34f-f2f3-ca84-59c0-0c9e5231f942, HandlerErrorCode: AlreadyExists)
```

To resolve this issue, you have a few options:

1. **Manual Deletion and Retry**: If it's safe to do so (meaning you don't have any important data or other dependencies on that bucket), you can manually delete the S3 bucket from the AWS Management Console or using the AWS CLI, and then retry the `cdk bootstrap` command. This approach is straightforward but requires caution to avoid deleting data unintentionally.

2. **Use a Different AWS Account or Region**: Since the bucket name collision is specific to an account and region, bootstrapping in a different account or region would not encounter this specific issue. This is mentioned only for completeness and might not be applicable to your situation.

3. **Customize Bootstrap Template**: CDK allows for customization of the bootstrap template, including specifying a different name for the staging bucket. This approach is more complex but can be useful in scenarios where you cannot delete the existing bucket and need to work within specific constraints.

Given the error, it seems there might have been a mix-up with the region in your command. You mentioned wanting to bootstrap in `us-east-1`, but the error message references `us-west-2`. Ensure you're specifying the correct profile and region when running the command. For example, if intending to bootstrap in `us-east-1`, ensure your command is correct, and your AWS profile is configured for the correct account:

```powershell
cdk bootstrap --region us-east-1 --profile mark
```

Double-check the region and profile you're using to ensure they align with your intent. Adjusting these and ensuring you're operating in the correct account and region can often resolve these kinds of issues.

The error you're encountering during the build process is due to the TypeScript compiler not being able to find type declarations for the `aws-lambda` package. This typically occurs because the `@types/aws-lambda` package, which provides TypeScript type definitions for AWS Lambda, is not installed in your project. 

To solve this issue, you should install `@types/aws-lambda` as a development dependency in your `cdk/` project where you're executing `yarn build`. Adding this package will provide TypeScript with the necessary type definitions for AWS Lambda, resolving the compilation error.

Run the following command in your `cdk/` directory:

```powershell
yarn add @types/aws-lambda --dev
```

This command adds the `@types/aws-lambda` package to your `devDependencies` in your `cdk/package.json`, allowing the TypeScript compiler to find and use the type definitions for AWS Lambda.

After installing `@types/aws-lambda`, try running `yarn build` again. The previously encountered error regarding the inability to find module 'aws-lambda' should now be resolved, and your TypeScript code should compile successfully.

Remember, whenever you're working with AWS services in TypeScript and encounter similar issues with missing types, you'll likely need to install the corresponding `@types/` package for that AWS service.

When I run `cdk bootstrap --retion us-east-1 --profile mark` I get this error:

```powershell
CDKToolkit | 2/12 | 7:56:24 AM | CREATE_FAILED    | AWS::S3::Bucket     | StagingBucket Resource handler returned message: "cdk-hnb659fds-assets-318364255844-us-west-2 already exists (Service: S3, Status Code: 0, Request ID: null)" (RequestToken: 507b394b-0fbb-41b6-e0d8-322b2f91b89d, HandlerErrorCode: AlreadyExists)
```

But I am having trouble finding that bucket. Can I just use `aws s3 ls` to search for that bucket?

---

**Codeium** _at 8:02 am, Jun 28, 2024_

The error message you're seeing indicates a conflict because an S3 bucket with the name `cdk-hnb659fds-assets-318364255844-us-west-2` already exists. This conflict prevents the CDK bootstrap process from completing successfully. 

To locate and confirm the existence of this bucket, you can indeed use the AWS CLI command `aws s3 ls` to list all S3 buckets in your account. However, `aws s3 ls` alone will list buckets across all regions without indicating the region of each bucket. Since your error specifies a bucket presumably in the `us-west-2` region, you might want to use a more targeted approach to confirm its presence and region.

Here are steps to help you manage this situation:

### 1. List All S3 Buckets
First, simply list all buckets to see if the bucket in question appears:
```powershell
aws s3 ls --profile mark
```
Make sure to replace `--profile mark` with the appropriate profile name if different, or omit it if you're using the default AWS CLI profile.

### 2. Confirm Bucket Region
If you find the bucket in question, you can confirm its region by using the `get-bucket-location` command:
```powershell
aws s3api get-bucket-location --bucket cdk-hnb659fds-assets-318364255844-us-west-2 --profile mark
```
This will return the bucket's region, which should be `us-west-2` according to your error message.

### 3. Understanding the Issue
If the bucket exists and is in the `us-west-2` region, but you intended to bootstrap in `us-east-1`, it suggests a possible confusion or misconfiguration in your setup. Ensure that you're operating in the correct AWS account and region.

### 4. Resolution
- If the bucket is unused and was created by a previous `cdk bootstrap` attempt, you could manually delete it using the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI:
  ```powershell
  aws s3 rb s3://cdk-hnb659fds-assets-318364255844-us-west-2 --force --profile mark
  ```
  The `--force` option deletes all objects in the bucket before removing the bucket itself.

- After resolving the bucket conflict, you can retry bootstrapping the correct account and region. However, there seems to be a typo in your command (`--retion` should be `--region`). The corrected command is:
  ```powershell
  cdk bootstrap --region us-east-1 --profile mark
  ```

### Note:
Ensure that you're operating within the correct AWS account and have selected the correct AWS profile with `--profile mark` to avoid affecting resources in unintended accounts.

**User** _at 8:04 am, Jun 28, 2024_

It says the bucket is not empty. Is there any way to delete the contents of the bucket from the cli?

---

**Codeium** _at 8:05 am, Jun 28, 2024_

Yes, you can delete the contents of an S3 bucket using the AWS CLI before removing the bucket itself. If the bucket is not empty, you need to first delete all objects and, if enabled, delete any versions of objects (for versioned buckets).

Here's how you can do it:

### 1. Delete All Objects in the Bucket

For a non-versioned bucket, you can use the `s3 rm` command with the `--recursive` option to delete all objects within the bucket:

```powershell
aws s3 rm s3://cdk-hnb659fds-assets-318364255844-us-west-2 --recursive --profile mark
```

### 2. Delete All Objects and Versions in a Versioned Bucket

If your bucket is versioned, you'll need to delete both the objects and their versions. You can use the following commands:

First, delete all objects:

```powershell
aws s3 rm s3://cdk-hnb659fds-assets-318364255844-us-west-2 --recursive --profile mark
```

Then, list and delete all versions and delete markers (this step is necessary for versioned buckets):

```powershell
aws s3api list-object-versions --bucket cdk-hnb659fds-assets-318364255844-us-west-2 --profile mark | aws s3api delete-objects --bucket cdk-hnb659fds-assets-318364255844-us-west-2 --delete "$(jq -r '.Versions, .DeleteMarkers | map({Key:.Key, VersionId:.VersionId})')" --profile mark
```

Note: The above command uses `jq`, a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor, to parse the output of `list-object-versions` and format it for `delete-objects`. Ensure you have `jq` installed on your system to use this command. If `jq` is not installed or you prefer not to use it, you'll need to manually format the output or use a script to automate the deletion of all versions and delete markers.

### 3. Delete the Bucket

After all objects and versions are deleted, you can delete the bucket:

```powershell
aws s3 rb s3://cdk-hnb659fds-assets-318364255844-us-west-2 --profile mark
```

This set of operations will ensure that the bucket is completely emptied of its contents and removed. Be sure to double-check the bucket name and AWS profile before running these commands to avoid deleting the wrong bucket or using the wrong account.

**User** _at 8:06 am, Jun 28, 2024_

how do I `aws s3 ls` and filter the bucket names with a wildcard?

---

**Codeium** _at 8:07 am, Jun 28, 2024_

The `aws s3 ls` command itself does not support filtering bucket names using a wildcard directly. However, you can achieve this by combining the `aws s3 ls` command with other command-line utilities such as `grep` for Linux and macOS, or `Select-String` for PowerShell on Windows.

### On Linux and macOS:

You can use `grep` to filter the bucket names. For example, to find buckets that include `cdk-hnb659fds-assets` in their names, you would use:

```bash
aws s3 ls --profile mark | grep 'cdk-hnb659fds-assets'
```

### On Windows (PowerShell):

You can use `Select-String` for a similar effect. Here's how you can filter bucket names in PowerShell:

```powershell
aws s3 ls --profile mark | Select-String 'cdk-hnb659fds-assets'
```

This command lists all your S3 buckets with the AWS CLI, and then filters the output for lines containing `cdk-hnb659fds-assets`, effectively giving you the result as if you were using a wildcard search.

Keep in mind, `grep` and `Select-String` are powerful tools, and you can adjust the pattern to match exactly what you're looking for. If your bucket naming convention includes dates, unique IDs, or specific prefixes/suffixes, you can tailor the search pattern to match those specifics.

```

---

**Codeium** _at 8:09 am, Jun 28, 2024_

When you encounter a message indicating that the bucket cannot be deleted because it contains versions (indicating it's a versioned bucket), you need to delete both the objects and all their versions before you can delete the bucket itself. The `--force` option with `aws s3 rb` does not remove versions of objects in a versioned bucket.

To delete all objects and their versions from a versioned bucket, you can use the AWS CLI with the following approach. This method involves first deleting all the objects and then deleting all versions and delete markers.

Unfortunately, as of my last update, the AWS CLI doesn't provide a simple one-liner command to delete all versions and delete markers for objects in a versioned bucket. You need to manually script this process.

Here's a step-by-step guide using AWS CLI commands:

### 1. **Enable versioning on the bucket (if not already enabled):**
This step is just for ensuring that versioning is indeed enabled. If it's already enabled, this command won't change anything.

```powershell
aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket cdk-hnb659fds-assets-318364255844-us-west-2 --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled --profile mark
```

### 2. **Delete all current objects:**

```powershell
aws s3 rm s3://cdk-hnb659fds-assets-318364255844-us-west-2 --recursive --profile mark
```

### 3. **Delete all object versions and delete markers:**
You'll need to script the deletion of all versions and delete markers. Here's a PowerShell script to accomplish this:

```powershell
$bucket = "cdk-hnb659fds-assets-318364255844-us-west-2"
$profile = "mark"

# List all versions
$versions = aws s3api list-object-versions --bucket $bucket --profile $profile | ConvertFrom-Json

# Delete object versions
$versions.Versions | ForEach-Object {
    aws s3api delete-object --bucket $bucket --key $_.Key --version-id $_.VersionId --profile $profile
}

# Delete delete markers
$versions.DeleteMarkers | ForEach-Object {
    aws s3api delete-object --bucket $bucket --key $_.Key --version-id $_.VersionId --profile $profile
}
```

This script lists all versions and delete markers, then iterates over them to delete each individually.

### 4. **Finally, delete the bucket:**

```powershell
aws s3 rb s3://cdk-hnb659fds-assets-318364255844-us-west-2 --force --profile mark
```

After running these commands, your bucket and all of its contents, including all versions and delete markers, should be completely deleted.

**Note:** Be very careful with these commands, especially when deleting objects and versions, as this operation is irreversible.

My default AWS CLI output is YAML. How do I specify in the command to use JSON for this command?

---

**Codeium** _at 8:13 am, Jun 28, 2024_

To specify the output format as JSON for a specific AWS CLI command when your default output format is set to YAML, you can use the `--output` option followed by `json` in your command. This option allows you to override the default output format for the duration of that command without changing your global AWS CLI configuration.

Here's how you would modify the script to ensure that commands expecting JSON input format work correctly, by explicitly setting the output format of the `list-object-versions` command to JSON:

### PowerShell Script with JSON Output Format

```powershell
$bucket = "cdk-hnb659fds-assets-318364255844-us-west-2"
$profile = "mark"

# List all versions with output set to JSON
$versions = aws s3api list-object-versions --bucket $bucket --output json --profile $profile | ConvertFrom-Json

# Delete object versions
$versions.Versions | ForEach-Object {
    aws s3api delete-object --bucket $bucket --key $_.Key --version-id $_.VersionId --output json --profile $profile
}

# Delete delete markers
$versions.DeleteMarkers | ForEach-Object {
    aws s3api delete-object --bucket $bucket --key $_.Key --version-id $_.VersionId --output json --profile $profile
}
```

By adding `--output json` to each AWS CLI command, you ensure that the commands output JSON format, which is then correctly handled by `ConvertFrom-Json` in PowerShell. This modification is crucial if your default output format is not JSON, as the parsing and subsequent operations rely on the JSON format.

### Additional Note

Remember, this script iterates over and deletes all versions and delete markers in the specified bucket. Ensure you have backed up any important data before running this script, as these operations are irreversible.

**User** _at 8:20 am, Jun 28, 2024_

That worked. I would like that script to print the number of items it will remove before removing them. How can I do that?

---

**Codeium** _at 8:20 am, Jun 28, 2024_

To print the number of items (object versions and delete markers) the script will remove before actually removing them, you can count the elements in each respective collection (`$versions.Versions` and `$versions.DeleteMarkers`) and output these counts before proceeding with the deletion. Here's how you can do it:

### Updated PowerShell Script with Counts

```powershell
$bucket = "cdk-hnb659fds-assets-318364255844-us-west-2"
$profile = "mark"

# List all versions with output set to JSON
$versions = aws s3api list-object-versions --bucket $bucket --output json --profile $profile | ConvertFrom-Json

# Count object versions and delete markers
$objectVersionsCount = $versions.Versions.Count
$deleteMarkersCount = $versions.DeleteMarkers.Count

# Print counts
Write-Host "Number of object versions to delete: $objectVersionsCount"
Write-Host "Number of delete markers to delete: $deleteMarkersCount"

# Confirmation before deletion
$confirmation = Read-Host "Do you want to proceed with deletion? (Y/N)"
if ($confirmation -ne 'Y') {
    Write-Host "Deletion cancelled."
    exit
}

# Delete object versions
$versions.Versions | ForEach-Object {
    aws s3api delete-object --bucket $bucket --key $_.Key --version-id $_.VersionId --output json --profile $profile
}

# Delete delete markers
$versions.DeleteMarkers | ForEach-Object {
    aws s3api delete-object --bucket $bucket --key $_.Key --version-id $_.VersionId --output json --profile $profile
}

Write-Host "Deletion completed."
```

This script now does the following:

1. Lists all object versions and delete markers and stores them in `$versions`.
2. Counts the number of object versions and delete markers and stores these counts in `$objectVersionsCount` and `$deleteMarkersCount` respectively.
3. Prints the counts to the console, providing you with information on how many items will be deleted.
4. Asks for user confirmation before proceeding with the deletion. If the user responds with 'Y', it proceeds; otherwise, it exits the script without deleting anything.
5. Proceeds to delete the object versions and delete markers if confirmation is given.
6. Prints a message upon completion of deletion.

This approach ensures you're informed about the number of items to be deleted and provides a simple confirmation step to prevent accidental deletion.

**User** _at 8:41 am, Jun 28, 2024_

I want my machine to default to `--profile mark` when using the AWS CLI.

I have a `[default]` in my `$HOME/.aws/credentials` and `$HOME/.aws/config` that both contain the `--profile mark` credentials, but my system still defaults to another account.

---

**Codeium** _at 8:41 am, Jun 28, 2024_

To set your AWS CLI to default to using the `--profile mark` for commands without having to specify `--profile mark` each time, you can leverage environment variables. The AWS CLI uses certain environment variables to determine its behavior, including which profile and credentials to use for operations.

Here's how you can set it up in PowerShell, which seems to be your shell of choice:

### Setting Environment Variables in PowerShell

To temporarily set the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable for the current session, you can use:

```powershell
$env:AWS_PROFILE = "mark"
```

This command will set the AWS CLI to use the `mark` profile for the duration of the session.

### Making the Change Permanent

If you want to make this change permanent across all PowerShell sessions, you can add the above line to your `Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1` file. This will automatically execute the command every time a new PowerShell session is started, setting the AWS CLI to use the `mark` profile by default.

1. Open your PowerShell profile file for editing. If you're not sure where this file is located, you can find it by checking the value of `$PROFILE` in PowerShell:

```powershell
Notepad $PROFILE
```

2. Add the following line to the end of the file:

```powershell
$env:AWS_PROFILE = "mark"
```

3. Save the file and close your editor.

Now, every new PowerShell session will default to using the `mark` profile for AWS CLI commands.

### Verifying the Configuration

To verify that your AWS CLI is now using the `mark` profile by default, you can run a test command that returns profile-specific information, such as listing your S3 buckets:

```powershell
aws s3 ls
```

This command should now execute using the permissions and settings of the `mark` profile without needing to specify `--profile mark`.

### Note on AWS Credentials and Config Files

Your `$HOME/.aws/credentials` and `$HOME/.aws/config` files work together to store your AWS CLI configuration and credentials. The `[default]` section in these files is used when no profile is explicitly specified and no environment variable overrides are present. By setting the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable to `mark`, you're effectively telling the AWS CLI to use the `[mark]` profile sections from these files by default.

**User** _at 9:01 am, Jun 28, 2024_

I deleted all the buckets involved but when I run `cdk deploy` I get this error:

```log

```

**Codeium** _at 9:01 am, Jun 28, 2024_

The error you're encountering, "A conflicting conditional operation is currently in progress against this resource. Please try again," typically occurs under a few circumstances when working with AWS S3:

1. **Recently Deleted Bucket Name:** If you've recently deleted an S3 bucket and are trying to create a new bucket with the same name, you might encounter this error. S3 bucket names are globally unique, and after deletion, there's a propagation delay before the name becomes available again. This delay can vary and AWS does not guarantee immediate availability of the name after deletion.

2. **Concurrent Operations:** If there are concurrent operations attempting to create or delete a bucket with the same name, this error can occur. This might happen in automated deployment pipelines where multiple processes are running in parallel.

### Steps to Resolve:

- **Wait and Retry:** The simplest approach is to wait a few minutes and then retry your `cdk deploy` command. This can often resolve the issue if it's related to AWS's internal propagation delay after a bucket deletion.

- **Check for Concurrent Deployments:** Ensure there are no other processes or team members trying to create or delete a bucket with the same name at the same time.

- **Unique Bucket Names:** Consider using a unique name for your S3 bucket if you're not already doing so. CDK supports dynamically generating unique bucket names if you don't explicitly specify a name, which can help avoid such conflicts. For example, you can create a bucket without specifying a name:

```typescript
new s3.Bucket(this, 'HandTermHistoryBucket', {
    // Bucket configuration...
});
```

In CDK, if you don't specify a `bucketName` property, AWS CDK automatically generates a unique bucket name at deployment time, which avoids naming conflicts.

- **Review Stack State in CloudFormation:** Sometimes, the stack might be in an inconsistent state. Check the AWS CloudFormation console for the status of your stack and any pending operations. If the stack is in a failed state due to this bucket issue, consider rolling back or deleting the stack and redeploying.

If after waiting, you continue to experience issues, double-check that there are no other AWS accounts or regions where a bucket with the same name might exist and be in a pending operation state. Bucket names are globally unique across all AWS accounts and regions, so a name conflict can arise from anywhere.

To include the API Gateway URL in your stack's output, which you can then use in your `useAuth.ts`, you first need to ensure that your CDK stack outputs the API Gateway endpoint URL. Assuming you are using Amazon API Gateway in your CDK stack, here's an example of how you can output the API Gateway URL:

### Adding an Output for the API Gateway URL in CDK

In your CDK stack (`HandTermCdkStack`), if you have an API Gateway defined, you should add an output for its URL. Let's say your API Gateway is instantiated as `api` in your CDK stack:

```typescript
const api = new apigateway.RestApi(this, 'MyAPI', {
  // Your API Gateway configuration
});

// Other resources and configurations

new cdk.CfnOutput(this, 'ApiUrl', {
  value: api.url,
  exportName: 'ApiUrl'
});
```

This code snippet creates a CloudFormation output for the API Gateway URL, which will be displayed when you deploy your CDK stack. The `api.url` attribute contains the URL endpoint for your deployed API Gateway.

### Updating `useAuth.ts` with the API URL

After you've successfully deployed your CDK stack with the API Gateway URL output, you'll see the URL in the stack outputs section in your terminal. You can then manually update `useAuth.ts` by replacing `https://your-api-gateway-url` with the actual URL:

```typescript
// Before
const API_BASE_URL = 'https://your-api-gateway-url';

// After (example)
const API_BASE_URL = 'https://xyz123.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod';
```

### Automating the Process

If you're looking for a way to automate this process, there are several approaches, but they typically involve some form of CI/CD pipeline or scripting to update your React app's environment variables or configuration files based on the output of the CDK deployment.

For a simple approach, you can use environment variables in your React app and update them as part of your deployment process. For example, you could set an environment variable in your CI/CD pipeline that updates the `.env` file or equivalent in your React app's root directory.

```env
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=https://xyz123.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod
```

Then, in your `useAuth.ts`, you would access this variable as follows:

```typescript
const API_BASE_URL = process.env.REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL;
```

Remember to restart your React application after updating environment variables to ensure the changes take effect.

This way, your React app's API base URL can be dynamically set based on the output of your CDK deployment, facilitating a more automated and error-free deployment process.

**Codeium** _at 9:43 am, Jun 28, 2024_

Given your current setup in `cdk/lib/cdk-stack.ts` and your need to invoke Lambda@Edge functions, it seems like your ultimate goal is to enhance your application's capabilities, possibly by intercepting and processing HTTP requests/responses at the edge location nearest to the end-user. Lambda@Edge functions are typically used with Amazon CloudFront, a content delivery network (CDN) service, to customize the content delivered to users.

Lambda@Edge functions can be triggered by CloudFront events, such as requests to and responses from your origin, without needing an API Gateway. However, if your application architecture requires API calls that are not directly related to content delivery or if you need an endpoint for your frontend to interact with AWS services, then setting up an API Gateway would be the way to go.

### Adding Amazon API Gateway for Backend APIs

If you need to create APIs for operations like user sign-up, login, session management, etc., and these operations are not served by Lambda@Edge, you'll want to add Amazon API Gateway to your stack. Here's a simplified example of how to add a REST API Gateway and integrate it with a Lambda function:

```typescript
import * as apigateway from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-apigateway';

// Assuming lambdaAtEdge is the Lambda function you want to use as a backend for some API calls
const api = new apigateway.RestApi(this, 'HandTermApi', {
  restApiName: 'HandTerm Service',
  description: 'Endpoint for HandTerm application.',
});

const lambdaIntegration = new apigateway.LambdaIntegration(lambdaAtEdge, {
  requestTemplates: { "application/json": '{ "statusCode": "200" }' }
});

api.root.addMethod('ANY', lambdaIntegration); // Example: Allow any HTTP method on the API root. Adjust as necessary.

// Output API Gateway endpoint URL
new cdk.CfnOutput(this, 'ApiGatewayUrl', { value: api.url });
```

This code snippet does the following:
- Defines a new REST API Gateway.
- Integrates the existing `lambdaAtEdge` Lambda function with the API Gateway. (Note: Typically, Lambda@Edge functions are used with CloudFront distributions. If your use case is specifically for API calls that don't involve CloudFront events, consider using standard Lambda functions instead.)
- Allows any HTTP method on the API root. You might want to define specific resources and methods depending on your application's requirements.
- Outputs the API Gateway endpoint URL, which you can use in your frontend application.

### Using Lambda@Edge with CloudFront

If your intention is to use Lambda@Edge functions for customizing content delivery with CloudFront, you don't need an API Gateway. Instead, you associate your Lambda@Edge function with specific CloudFront distribution events. Here's an example snippet for creating a CloudFront distribution and associating a Lambda@Edge function with it:

```typescript
import * as cloudfront from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-cloudfront';

const distribution = new cloudfront.Distribution(this, 'MyDistribution', {
  defaultBehavior: {
    origin: new origins.S3Origin(logsBucket), // Assuming logsBucket is your S3 bucket
    edgeLambdas: [
      {
        functionVersion: lambdaAtEdge.currentVersion,
        eventType: cloudfront.LambdaEdgeEventType.VIEWER_REQUEST, // Or another event type as needed
      },
    ],
  },
  // Additional configuration...
});
```

This code sets up a CloudFront distribution with your S3 bucket as the origin and associates your Lambda@Edge function to be triggered on viewer requests.

### Conclusion

Decide whether you need an API Gateway based on whether or not your application requires API endpoints for backend interactions. If your use case is primarily related to content delivery and customization with CloudFront, then focusing on Lambda@Edge with CloudFront might be sufficient.

My initial intention was just to provide HttpOnly Cookies to prevent XSS attacks, but additionally I need the app to store user logs in a way that is only accessable by the each user. Secure S3 storage for each user. 

Which implementation would be better for that? The logs will be write-once-read-many.

---

**Codeium** _at 9:54 am, Jun 28, 2024_

For your requirements of providing HttpOnly cookies to prevent XSS attacks and securely storing user logs in S3 where they are accessible only by each respective user, you would likely need a combination of services including Amazon Cognito, AWS Lambda, Amazon S3, and potentially Amazon API Gateway, depending on how you wish to manage access and authentication. Here's a high-level approach to implementing this:

### 1. **HttpOnly Cookies for Session Management:**

- **Lambda@Edge:** You're on the right track with Lambda@Edge for setting HttpOnly cookies. This is particularly useful for reading cookies on requests and setting them on responses at the CloudFront edge locations, enhancing security by restricting access to the cookie from client-side scripts and thereby mitigating XSS attacks.
- **CloudFront Distribution:** Use CloudFront to serve your application and configure Lambda@Edge to intercept requests/responses for setting or validating HttpOnly cookies.

### 2. **Secure S3 Storage for User Logs:**

For securely storing user logs in S3 and ensuring they are accessible only by each user, use the following architecture:

- **Amazon Cognito:** Utilize Amazon Cognito for user authentication. Each user will have a unique identifier (UserID).
- **Amazon S3 Bucket Configuration:**
  - Create a single S3 bucket to store user logs.
  - Use a naming convention for log files that includes the UserID, ensuring segregation of data. For example, `logs/{UserID}/log1.txt`.
  - Enable S3 server-side encryption for data at rest for additional security.
- **IAM Role for Lambda Function:** Create an IAM role with permissions to write to the S3 bucket and assume by Lambda functions.
- **AWS Lambda for Log Uploads:**
  - Develop a Lambda function that handles log uploads. This function can be triggered directly from your application via API Gateway or from other AWS services.
  - The Lambda function should extract the UserID from the context provided by Amazon Cognito (passed through API Gateway) to ensure users can only write to their designated log file prefix.
- **Fine-Grained Access Control:**
  - Implement fine-grained access control with S3 bucket policies or IAM policies to restrict access based on the Cognito UserID, ensuring users can only access their own logs.
  - Alternatively, generate pre-signed URLs with Lambda for secure, temporary access to a user's logs without exposing them directly.

### 3. **API Gateway for Secure API Endpoints (Optional):**

- If your application requires a backend to manage log uploads or fetches (beyond direct S3 access), consider using API Gateway integrated with Lambda and Cognito for authentication.
- API Gateway can be configured to use Cognito User Pools for authentication, ensuring that API requests are authorized. It can also pass the UserID context to Lambda, which then operates on S3.

### Implementation Sketch:

```typescript
const userPool = new cognito.UserPool(this, 'HandTermUserPool', {
  // Configuration...
});

const api = new apigateway.RestApi(this, 'HandTermApi', {
  restApiName: 'HandTerm Service',
  // Configuration...
});

api.root.addMethod('POST', new apigateway.LambdaIntegration(uploadLogLambda), {
  authorizationType: apigateway.AuthorizationType.COGNITO,
  authorizer: new apigateway.CognitoUserPoolsAuthorizer(this, 'CognitoAuthorizer', {
    cognitoUserPools: [userPool]
  }),
});

const uploadLogLambda = new lambda.Function(this, 'UploadLogFunction', {
  // Configuration...
  environment: {
    BUCKET_NAME: logsBucket.bucketName,
  },
});

// IAM role for Lambda with S3 access
const lambdaExecutionRole = new iam.Role(this, 'LambdaExecutionRole', {
  // Configuration...
  managedPolicies: [
    iam.ManagedPolicy.fromAwsManagedPolicyName('service-role/AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole'),
    new iam.PolicyStatement({
      actions: ['s3:PutObject'],
      resources: [logsBucket.bucketArn + '/logs/*'],
    }),
  ],
});
```

This approach provides a secure, scalable way to handle user sessions with HttpOnly cookies and store user logs in S3 with access control. Each component plays a role in ensuring that log data is securely written and accessible only by the user it belongs to, aligning with your requirements for security and user data isolation.
