summary: The chat conversation revolved around a user encountering a `TypeError: this.setState is not a function` error in a React application and seeking assistance in resolving it. The user provided code snippets that demonstrated how the `setState` function was being used in a method called `setZombie4Action`, and the error was occurring in a method called `handlePhraseSuccess`.

The assistant offered explanations on why the error might be happening, such as incorrect binding of `this` context in React classes, especially when passing methods as props to child components. The user confirmed that converting `handlePhraseSuccess` to an arrow function resolved the issue.

Further discussion included best practices for managing `this` context in React, such as using arrow functions or binding in the constructor to ensure the correct context. The topic of creating new functions on each render and its potential impact on performance was also addressed, along with a suggestion to define a method in the class to handle state changes.

Finally, the user encountered an issue where the hero character did not render until the `ActionType` was changed after implementing the recommended class method for handling position changes. The assistant provided troubleshooting steps to identify potential issues related to initial state setup, component lifecycle methods, rendering logic, dependency on state updates, and conditional rendering.

Overall, the chat covered topics related to debugging `this` context issues, best practices for React development, and troubleshooting rendering issues in a React component.

I just got this error:

```

react-dom.development.js:22878

I think it was on this line of code:

```tsx
 setZombie4Action = (newAction: ActionType) => {
  this.setState({ zombie4Action: newAction });
 }
```

The error message `this.setState is not a function` indicates that `this` is not referencing the component instance when `setZombie4Action` is called. This typically happens due to incorrect binding of the `this` context in event handlers or callbacks in React classes.

One common way to ensure that `this` is correctly bound in callbacks is to use an arrow function when passing the callback, or to bind `this` in the component's constructor. Since `setZombie4Action` is already an arrow function, it should have `this` correctly bound, assuming it's being used in the same component where `setState` is available.

However, the error might occur if `setZombie4Action` is being passed as a prop to a child component and then called from there. If the method is passed without binding, it will lose its context. To fix this, you can bind the function in the constructor of `HandexTerm.tsx` or make sure to pass it correctly with an arrow function.

Here's how you can bind it in the constructor:

```tsx
constructor(props) {
  super(props);
  // ... other initializations

  this.setZombie4Action = this.setZombie4Action.bind(this);
}
```

Or, if you are passing it to a child component, make sure to pass it with an arrow function to maintain the context:

```tsx
<ChildComponent onActionChange={(action) => this.setZombie4Action(action)} />
```

Please check where and how `setZombie4Action` is being called. If this function is being passed as a prop and used in a different context than `HandexTerm.tsx`, you will need to ensure that `this` is correctly bound when it's called. If further context is required, please provide information about where `setZombie4Action` is being used.

I have a very similar state-pipeline for the Hero and it is working consistently every time I run the app:

```tsx
 setHeroAction = (newAction: ActionType) => {
  this.setState({ heroAction: newAction });
 }

 setZombie4Action = (newAction: ActionType) => {
  this.setState({ zombie4Action: newAction });
 }
```

```tsx
    <TerminalGame
     ref={this.terminalGameRef}
     canvasHeight={this.canvasHeight}
     canvasWidth={canvasWidth} // Use the width from terminalSize if available
     isInPhraseMode={this.state.isInPhraseMode}
     heroAction={this.state.heroAction}
     zombie4Action={this.state.zombie4Action}
     onTouchStart={this.handleTouchStart}
     onTouchEnd={this.handleTouchEnd}
    />
```

And it's being called from here:

```tsx
 handlePhraseSuccess(phrase: string, wpm: number) {
  console.log('XtermAdapter onPhraseSuccess', phrase, wpm);
  this.setState(prevState => ({ outputElements: [...prevState.outputElements, wpm.toString() + ":" + phrase] }));
  this.setZombie4Action('Die');
  console.log('XtermAdapter onPhraseSuccess, setZombie4Action Die', phrase, wpm);
  this.adapterRef.current?.prompt();
 }
```

Given that `setHeroAction` works consistently, and both `setHeroAction` and `setZombie4Action` are set up similarly, the issue seems to be with how `handlePhraseSuccess` is called or defined rather than with `setZombie4Action` itself.

The error could be a result of `handlePhraseSuccess` being called with the wrong `this` context. If `handlePhraseSuccess` is passed as a callback to a child component or an event handler and is not an arrow function, it would lose the context of `this`.

In the provided snippet from `handlePhraseSuccess`:

```tsx
handlePhraseSuccess(phrase: string, wpm: number) {
  console.log('XtermAdapter onPhraseSuccess', phrase, wpm);
  this.setState(prevState => ({ outputElements: [...prevState.outputElements, wpm.toString() + ":" + phrase] }));
  this.setZombie4Action('Die');
  console.log('XtermAdapter onPhraseSuccess, setZombie4Action Die', phrase, wpm);
  this.adapterRef.current?.prompt();
}
```

If `handlePhraseSuccess` is not an arrow function and is passed as a prop to a child component like `NextCharsDisplay`, you would need to bind it to maintain the correct context. However, if `handlePhraseSuccess` is already an arrow function or is correctly bound in the constructor, the context of `this` should be preserved.

Please verify if `handlePhraseSuccess` is an arrow function. If it's not, you can either convert it to an arrow function or bind it in the constructor of the `HandexTerm` class.

Converting to arrow function:

```tsx
handlePhraseSuccess = (phrase: string, wpm: number) => {
  // Function implementation
};
```

Or binding in the constructor:

```tsx
constructor(props) {
  super(props);
  // ... other initializations

  this.handlePhraseSuccess = this.handlePhraseSuccess.bind(this);
}
```

Additionally, ensure that `handlePhraseSuccess` is being called correctly, especially if it's being passed as a prop to child components like `NextCharsDisplay`. If you're passing it as a prop, you should do so like this:

```tsx
<NextCharsDisplay onPhraseSuccess={this.handlePhraseSuccess} />
```

If you've verified all of these and the error persists, please check if any other modifications to the state or props handling could be causing the context of `this` to change when `handlePhraseSuccess` is invoked. If the problem continues, please provide more context or additional code where `handlePhraseSuccess` is being used.

The arrow function fixed it.

That must be an issue all over React apps.

Yes, handling the `this` context is a common source of bugs in React, especially for those new to the framework or to JavaScript's nuances with function contexts. Arrow functions are often used in React to automatically bind the function to the context of the class instance, which is why converting `handlePhraseSuccess` to an arrow function solved the issue.

Here are a few best practices to manage `this` context in React class components:

1. **Arrow Functions in Class Properties:**
   Using arrow functions for class methods that need to access `this` (like event handlers or callbacks) is a common practice, as you've seen with `handlePhraseAction`.

2. **Binding in Constructor:**
   Another approach is to explicitly bind methods in the constructor, which can be more verbose but just as effective.

3. **Passing Arrow Functions in Render:**
   You can also pass arrow functions directly in props when rendering, like so:
   ```tsx
   <SomeComponent onClick={() => this.handleClick()} />
   ```
   However, this can create a new function on every render, which might lead to performance issues in some cases.

4. **Using Class Properties Plugin (Babel):**
   If you're using Babel, the class properties plugin allows you to use arrow functions as class properties, which avoids the need for binding in the constructor.

5. **React Hooks:**
   With the introduction of hooks, functional components can be used instead of class components, which avoids the `this` binding issue altogether. Hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` can manage state and side effects in functional components.

6. **Consistent Patterns:**
   Consistency is key. Choose an approach that works for your team and stick to it throughout the codebase.

It's important to choose a pattern and use it consistently throughout your application to avoid these kinds of issues. Arrow functions are a good choice for their simplicity and ease of use.

Does this create a new `onPositionChange` function every time it's rendered?

```tsx
    {this.hero &&
     <CharacterActionComponent
      currentActionType={this.props.heroAction}
      name="hero"
      canvasWidth={this.props.canvasWidth}
      baseCharacter={this.hero}
      position={this.state.heroPosition}
      onPositionChange={
       (newPosition) => this.setState({ heroPosition: newPosition })
      }
      isInScrollMode={this.isInScrollMode}
     />
    }
```

**Codeium** _at 7:14 pm, Jun 4, 2024_

Yes, the way `onPositionChange` is defined in the snippet will indeed create a new function every time the component renders. This isn't necessarily a problem, but it can lead to suboptimal performance if the `CharacterActionComponent` is re-rendered often or if it has many child components that could be affected by receiving new prop instances on each render.

To prevent this, you could define a method in the class that handles the position change, and then pass that method as the `onPositionChange` prop:

```tsx
class TerminalGame extends React.Component<ITerminalGameProps, ITerminalGameState> {
  // Existing class methods and lifecycle methods...

  handleHeroPositionChange = (newPosition: SpritePosition) => {
    this.setState({ heroPosition: newPosition });
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <>
        {this.hero && (
          <CharacterActionComponent
            currentActionType={this.props.heroAction}
            name="hero"
            canvasWidth={this.props.canvasWidth}
            baseCharacter={this.hero}
            position={this.state.heroPosition}
            onPositionChange={this.handleHeroPositionChange}
            isInScrollMode={this.isInScrollMode}
          />
        )}
        {/* ...other components... */}
      </>
    );
  }
}
```

Now, `handleHeroPositionChange` is an arrow function defined as a class property, and it will be automatically bound to the class instance. This method will not be recreated on each render, so the `CharacterActionComponent` will receive the same function instance every time, which can help with performance optimizations like PureComponent and `shouldComponentUpdate`.

I like the idea of doing that, but when I do that, the hero doesn't render until I change his `ActionType`

---

**Codeium** _at 7:34 pm, Jun 4, 2024_

If the hero character does not render until you change the `ActionType`, it suggests that the initial render does not trigger the necessary state update or side effect to draw the hero. This may be related to how your rendering logic is set up in relation to the `ActionType` and state changes.

Check the following areas for potential issues:

1. **Initial State**: Ensure that the initial state for the hero's `ActionType` and position is set correctly in the `TerminalGame` component's constructor or state definition.

2. **ComponentDidMount**: Verify that any initialization logic that needs to run when the component mounts (such as setting up the canvas context or starting the initial animation loop) is correctly implemented in the `componentDidMount` lifecycle method.

3. **CharacterActionComponent**: Ensure that the `CharacterActionComponent` (or any other component responsible for rendering the hero) is correctly responding to the initial props it receives. If it has a `useEffect` or similar hook that depends on `ActionType`, make sure the effect runs on component mount.

4. **Drawing Logic**: If there's a method responsible for drawing the hero (like `drawHero`), check if it's being called after the initial state is set and if it's getting the initial `ActionType` correctly.

5. **Props vs. State**: If the drawing logic relies on state that is supposed to be initialized from props, ensure that the state is correctly set from the props when the component is first mounted.

6. **Rendering Conditions**: Review any conditional rendering logic that might prevent the hero from rendering until state changes occur.

Given that you've implemented the `handleHeroPositionChange` method, you might want to check whether the `CharacterActionComponent` or related rendering logic depends on the `heroPosition` state being updated through `setState` for the hero to render. If that's the case, you may need to ensure that the initial position is set and that the drawing logic does not solely rely on a state update to trigger rendering.

If the hero renders correctly with the inline function but not when using the class method, it's possible that a dependency on the state being set in a specific way is causing the issue. In this case, you might want to review how the rendering is initiated and whether it's correctly tied to the component lifecycle or if there's an implicit dependency on `setState` being called to kick off the rendering process.

Without seeing the full implementation of how the rendering is triggered, it's difficult to provide a more specific solution. If you continue to face issues, please provide more details about the rendering logic and how `ActionType` and `heroPosition` are used to draw the hero.
