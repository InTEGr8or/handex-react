How can I publish this Vite React app as a static app on GitHub Pages using the existing GH repository that it's in?

I think I can just add a `.github/workflows/` file and run some `gh` command lines, right?

To publish your Vite React app as a static app on GitHub Pages, you need to set up a GitHub Actions workflow and configure your project to output the build to a specific branch (usually `gh-pages`). Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Configure Vite for GitHub Pages**: Ensure your `vite.config.js` (or `vite.config.ts` if using TypeScript) has the correct base path set for GitHub Pages, which is typically the repository name prefixed by a slash.

    ```javascript
    // vite.config.js or vite.config.ts
    export default defineConfig({
      base: '/<repository-name>/',
      // ... other configurations
    });
    ```

2. **Create GitHub Actions Workflow**:
   - Navigate to your GitHub repository and create a new workflow file in the following path: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

    ```yaml
    name: Build and Deploy to GitHub Pages
    on:
      push:
        branches:
          - main  # Set this to your default branch

    jobs:
      build-and-deploy:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v2

          - name: Setup Node.js
            uses: actions/setup-node@v2
            with:
              node-version: '14'  # Set this to the node version you prefer

          - name: Install dependencies
            run: npm install  # or use yarn

          - name: Build
            run: npm run build  # or use yarn

          - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
            uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
            with:
              github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
              publish_dir: ./dist  # Set this to the output directory of Vite build
    ```

3. **Update Package Scripts**: Add a `predeploy` and `deploy` script to your `package.json` to build the project and push it to the `gh-pages` branch. The `gh-pages` package can be used for this.

    ```json
    {
      "scripts": {
        "predeploy": "npm run build",
        "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"  // Replace 'dist' with your build output directory
      }
    }
    ```

4. **Commit Workflow File**: Commit the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file to your repository.

5. **Push to GitHub**: Push your changes to the repository. The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically run and deploy your app to GitHub Pages.

After setting this up, every push to the `main` branch (or your default branch) will trigger the GitHub Actions workflow, build your app, and deploy it to GitHub Pages.

Please note that, in this setup, the `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3` action is used to deploy the build artifacts, so you don't need to run the `gh-pages` command line manually. The action handles the deployment process for you.

Should `predeploy` = `vite build`?

In the context of a Vite project, you would indeed use `vite build` to create a production build of your app. If you are setting up scripts in your `package.json`, you will typically have a `build` script that runs `vite build`. Here's how you would set up your `package.json` scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "vite build",
    "predeploy": "npm run build",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
  }
}
```

The `predeploy` script is a convenience that makes sure the `build` script is run automatically before `deploy` when you run `npm run deploy`. Since the `build` script already runs `vite build`, you don't need to specify `vite build` again in `predeploy`; you can just call `npm run build`.

However, for the GitHub Actions workflow, you don't need to rely on the `predeploy` or `deploy` scripts. The workflow will directly run the build command and use the action `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3` to deploy to GitHub Pages. So the relevant part of your workflow file will look like this:

```yaml
- name: Install dependencies
  run: npm install  # or use yarn if you prefer

- name: Build
  run: npm run build  # This will run the "build" script, which in turn runs "vite build"

- name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
  with:
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    publish_dir: ./dist  # Replace with your Vite project's build output directory
```

The `deploy.yml` file in your `.github/workflows` directory will handle the entire process on GitHub's servers when you push changes to your repository.

My repo looks like this, so what should I set as the `base` in the `vite.config.ts`?

```pwsh
[12:00:03]❯ gh repo view  
InTEGr8or/handex-react
No description provided


  Handex Terminal

```

Given your repository URL `https://github.com/InTEGr8or/handex-react`, the `base` in your `vite.config.ts` should be set to the repository name with a leading slash. For your repository, it should be `/handex-react/`. Here's how you should set it:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  base: '/handex-react/'
})
```

This will ensure that Vite correctly references the resources relative to the base URL of your GitHub Pages site.

now, the images don't work. 

They were in `http://localhost:5173/images/svgs/9.svg`

If the images are not loading after deployment, it's likely because the paths to the images are not correct for the GitHub Pages environment. You need to make sure the paths are relative to the `base` you set in your `vite.config.ts`.

Assuming you have set the `base` in your `vite.config.ts` correctly as `/handex-react/`, and your images are located in the `public/images/svgs` directory of your project, you can reference them in your code like this:

```tsx
<img src="/handex-react/images/svgs/9.svg" alt="description" />
```

However, if you want to avoid hardcoding the base path, you can use the `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` variable provided by Vite, which automatically includes the base path.

Here is an example of how to use it:

```tsx
<img src={`${import.meta.env.BASE_URL}images/svgs/9.svg`} alt="description" />
```

Vite will replace `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` with the correct base path during the build process, ensuring that your assets point to the correct URLs on both your local development server and the GitHub Pages environment. Make sure to move your images into the `public` folder if they are not already there, as Vite will copy the contents of the `public` folder to the root of the build output directory (`dist` by default).

Remember to check the network tab in your browser's developer tools to see if there are any 404 errors when trying to load the images, which can help you diagnose path issues.

OK, I currently have this in the `ErrorDisplay.tsx`

```tsx
 return (
  <div style={{ display: props.isVisible ? 'block' : 'none'}} >
   <div>Error Count: {errorCount}</div>
   <div className="chord-image-holder" id="chord-image-holder" data-source="ErrorDisplay.tsx">
    <div className="col-sm-2 row generated next" id="chord2" >
     <span id="char15">{mismatchedChar}</span>
     <img loading="lazy" alt="2" src={`/images/svgs/${mismatchedCharCode}.svg`} width="100" className="hand"></img>
    </div></div>
  </div>
 );
```

To make sure the image paths work both locally and on GitHub Pages after setting the `base` in `vite.config.ts`, you should update the `src` attribute of the `img` tag to include the `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` as follows:

```tsx
return (
  <div style={{ display: props.isVisible ? 'block' : 'none'}} >
    <div>Error Count: {errorCount}</div>
    <div className="chord-image-holder" id="chord-image-holder" data-source="ErrorDisplay.tsx">
      <div className="col-sm-2 row generated next" id="chord2" >
        <span id="char15">{mismatchedChar}</span>
        <img loading="lazy" alt="2" src={`${import.meta.env.BASE_URL}images/svgs/${mismatchedCharCode}.svg`} width="100" className="hand"></img>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
);
```

The `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` will be replaced with the correct base path during the build process, so it will point to `/handex-react/` when deployed on GitHub Pages, and it will be `/` when you are running your Vite dev server locally. This allows your image paths to be correct in both development and production environments.

I see. That works.

Great! I'm glad to hear that it works. If you have any more questions or need further assistance with your Vite React TypeScript project or anything else, feel free to ask. Good luck with your development!
