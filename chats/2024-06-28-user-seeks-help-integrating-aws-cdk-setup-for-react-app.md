**User** _at 10:38 am, Jun 28, 2024_

You have helped me create a AWS CDK for an authentication and S3 storage solution for my app.

```ts
// cdk/lib/cdk-stack.ts

import { aws_cognito as cognito, aws_s3 as s3, aws_lambda as lambda, aws_iam as iam, aws_cloudfront as cloudfront } from "aws-cdk-lib";
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';

export class HandTermCdkStack extends cdk.Stack {
 constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
  super(scope, id, props);

  // Cognito User Pool
  const userPool = new cognito.UserPool(this, 'HandTermUserPool', {
   userPoolName: 'HandTermUserPool',
   selfSignUpEnabled: true,
   userVerification: {
    emailSubject: 'Verify your email for our app!',
    emailBody: 'Hello {username}, Thanks for signing up to our app! Your verification code is {####}',
    emailStyle: cognito.VerificationEmailStyle.CODE,
   },
   signInAliases: {
    email: true
   },
   passwordPolicy: {
    minLength: 8,
    requireUppercase: true,
    requireLowercase: true,
    requireDigits: true,
    requireSymbols: true,
   },
   autoVerify: { email: true }
  });

  // Cognito User Pool Client
  const userPoolClient = userPool.addClient('AppClient', {
   authFlows: {
    userSrp: true,
   },
   generateSecret: false,
  });

  // Cognito Identity Pool
  const identityPool = new cognito.CfnIdentityPool(this, 'HandTermIdentityPool', {
   identityPoolName: 'HandTermIdentityPool',
   allowUnauthenticatedIdentities: false,
   cognitoIdentityProviders: [{
    clientId: userPoolClient.userPoolClientId,
    providerName: userPool.userPoolProviderName,
   }],
  });

  // S3 Bucket for User Logs
  const logsBucket = new s3.Bucket(this, 'HandTermHistoryBucket', {
   bucketName: 'handterm',
   blockPublicAccess: s3.BlockPublicAccess.BLOCK_ALL,
   encryption: s3.BucketEncryption.S3_MANAGED,
  });

  // Lambda Execution Role
  const lambdaExecutionRole = new iam.Role(this, 'LambdaExecutionRole', {
   assumedBy: new iam.CompositePrincipal(
    new iam.ServicePrincipal('lambda.amazonaws.com'),

   ),
   managedPolicies: [
    iam.ManagedPolicy.fromAwsManagedPolicyName('service-role/AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole'),
    iam.ManagedPolicy.fromAwsManagedPolicyName('AmazonS3FullAccess'),
   ],
  });

  // Lambda@Edge Function for HttpOnly Cookies
  const lambdaAtEdge = new lambda.Function(this, 'LambdaAtEdgeFunction', {
   runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_16_X, // Note: Ensure you're using a runtime supported by Lambda@Edge
   handler: 'app.lambdaHandler', // Adjusted to point to the transpiled JS file and handler
   code: lambda.Code.fromAsset('lambda/handtermEdgeFunction/'), // Pointing to the directory
   role: lambdaExecutionRole,

   description: 'A Lambda@Edge function for HttpOnly Cookies',
  });


  // Outputs
  new cdk.CfnOutput(this, 'UserPoolId', { value: userPool.userPoolId });
  new cdk.CfnOutput(this, 'UserPoolClientId', { value: userPoolClient.userPoolClientId });
  new cdk.CfnOutput(this, 'IdentityPoolId', { value: identityPool.ref });
  new cdk.CfnOutput(this, 'BucketName', { value: logsBucket.bucketName });

 }
}

const app = new cdk.App();
new HandTermCdkStack(app, 'HandTermCdkStack');
```

It's intended to provide an HttpOnly Cookies feature, to prevent XSS:

};
```

I will also need it for storing user logs that are secure and private to each user.

I don't think the process is complete. I need your help completing it.

I am not sure if I should be using an API Gateway or CloudFront, but I don't think either of them are in my `cdk-stack`.

**Codeium** _at 10:38 am, Jun 28, 2024_

Given the details you've provided and the goal of integrating an authentication system with AWS services for your React app, it seems like there are a few additional components and considerations to finalize the architecture and make it fully functional. Let’s address the missing parts and clarify the use of API Gateway vs. CloudFront in your setup.

### Completing the Authentication and Storage Solution

1. **API Gateway vs. CloudFront:**
   - **API Gateway** is primarily used to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. It acts as a front door to access data, business logic, or functionality from your back-end services. It's suitable for handling RESTful APIs that your React app would consume for operations like login, signup, and session management.
   - **CloudFront** is a fast content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to customers globally with low latency and high transfer speeds. CloudFront can be used in front of API Gateway to cache API responses where applicable and to distribute static content (e.g., JavaScript, CSS, images) for your React app.

Given your setup, you will likely need both: CloudFront to serve your React app and potentially cache API responses, and API Gateway for the backend APIs your React app communicates with (e.g., login, signup, session management).

2. **Missing API Gateway Integration in CDK Stack:**
   To integrate API Gateway with your backend services (e.g., Lambda functions for authentication), you'll need to add resources to your CDQ stack. Here's a basic example of how to add an API Gateway REST API and connect it to a Lambda function:

   ```ts
   import { aws_apigateway as apigateway } from 'aws-cdk-lib';

   // Assuming lambdaAtEdge is your authentication Lambda function
   const api = new apigateway.RestApi(this, 'HandTermApi', {
     restApiName: 'HandTerm Service',
     description: 'This service serves authentication requests.',
   });

   const authLambdaIntegration = new apigateway.LambdaIntegration(lambdaAtEdge, {
     requestTemplates: { "application/json": '{ "statusCode": "200" }' }
   });

   api.root.addMethod('POST', authLambdaIntegration); // Adding a POST method
   ```

   This is a simplified example. You would likely have multiple endpoints for different authentication-related actions (e.g., login, logout, signup), each potentially backed by different Lambda functions or the same Lambda with different handlers.

3. **Updating `useAuth` to Point to API Gateway:**
   After you've set up API Gateway, you'll need to update the `API_BASE_URL` in your `useCursorAuth.ts` file to point to the API Gateway endpoint. You can find this URL in the API Gateway console or as an output from your CDK stack.

4. **Securing S3 Buckets for User Logs:**
   - It looks like you've already created an S3 bucket for user logs. Ensure access is properly secured and that only authenticated users can access their own logs.
   - Consider using S3 bucket policies or IAM roles to secure access. You might also need to integrate this part with your Lambda function or backend logic to fetch or write logs based on the authenticated user context.

5. **Deployment and Testing:**
   - Deploy your CDK stack to AWS. This will create all the resources defined in your stack.
   - Test your setup thoroughly. Ensure that the authentication flow works as expected from your React app, and that user logs are correctly written to and accessed from the S3 bucket in a secure manner.

6. **CloudFront Distribution for the React App:**
   - If you haven't already, set up a CloudFront distribution to serve your React app. This ensures that your app is delivered quickly to users worldwide.
   - You can configure CloudFront to point to an S3 bucket where your React app build artifacts are stored or directly to your API Gateway for dynamic content.

This overview should help you complete your authentication and storage solution for your app. Each step may involve additional configuration or considerations specific to your application's needs.

**User** _at 11:50 am, Jun 28, 2024_

I have already created the S3 bucket, and I have successfully deployed the CDK with your `apigateway` update.

I don't think I fully understand how the ApiGateway and Lambda function will operate between the `useAuth` and Cognito service. Do I need to create a new ApeGateway endpoint for every feature that I will use from Cognito?

Also, I have a `cdk\test\cdk.test.ts` and I am going to need your help building it out to test the features you mentioned.

```ts
import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import { Template } from 'aws-cdk-lib/assertions';
import * as Cdk from '../lib/cdk-stack';

// example test. To run these tests, uncomment this file along with the
// example resource in lib/cdk-stack.ts
test('API Gateway REST API Created', () => {
  const app = new cdk.App();
  // WHEN
  const stack = new Cdk.HandTermCdkStack(app, 'MyTestStack');
  // THEN
  const template = Template.fromStack(stack);
  template.hasResourceProperties('AWS::ApiGateway::RestApi', {
    Name: 'api',
  });
});
```

### Understanding API Gateway and Lambda Functions with Cognito

When integrating AWS Cognito with API Gateway and Lambda functions, you essentially create a backend that interfaces between your React application (or any frontend) and the AWS Cognito service. This backend layer allows you to implement custom authentication flows, securely manage tokens, and add custom logic or transformations to the requests and responses between your frontend and Cognito.

You don't necessarily need to create a new API Gateway endpoint for every single feature provided by Cognito. Instead, you can create endpoints for the functionalities you need to expose to your frontend. Common practices include:

- **Authentication Endpoints:** A few endpoints like `/login`, `/logout`, `/signup`, and `/refresh` could cover the basic authentication flows. The `/login` endpoint, for example, can use Cognito to authenticate the user and might return custom tokens or session details.
- **User Management Endpoints:** If your application requires functionality like updating user profiles, changing passwords, or managing user attributes, you might add specific endpoints for these actions.

Each endpoint can trigger a Lambda function that interacts with Cognito using the AWS SDK. The Lambda function can perform operations like signing in a user, refreshing tokens, or registering a new user, and then respond back to the frontend with the results.

### Expanding `cdk.test.ts` for Testing Features

For testing features related to API Gateway, Cognito, and S3, you can expand your `cdk.test.ts` to include assertions that check for the existence of these resources and their configurations. Here’s how you can start expanding your tests:

1. **Testing Cognito User Pool and Client Creation:**

```ts
test('Cognito User Pool and Client Created', () => {
  const app = new cdk.App();
  const stack = new Cdk.HandTermCdkStack(app, 'MyTestStack');
  
  const template = Template.fromStack(stack);

  // Test for the User Pool
  template.hasResourceProperties('AWS::Cognito::UserPool', {
    UserPoolName: 'HandTermUserPool',
  });

  // Test for the User Pool Client
  template.hasResource('AWS::Cognito::UserPoolClient', {
    Properties: {
      ExplicitAuthFlows: [
        'ALLOW_USER_SRP_AUTH',
        'ALLOW_REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH'
      ]
    }
  });
});
```

2. **Testing S3 Bucket Creation:**

```ts
test('S3 Bucket for User Logs Created', () => {
  const app = new cdk.App();
  const stack = new Cdk.HandTermCdkStack(app, 'MyTestStack');
  
  const template = Template.fromStack(stack);

  // Test for the S3 Bucket
  template.hasResourceProperties('AWS::S3::Bucket', {
    BucketName: 'handterm'
  });
});
```

3. **Testing LambdaAtEdge Function Creation:**

```ts
test('Lambda@Edge Function for HttpOnly Cookies Created', () => {
  const app = new cdk.App();
  const stack = new Cdk.HandTermCdkStack(app, 'MyTestStack');
  
  const template = Template.fromStack(stack);

  // Test for the Lambda@Edge function
  template.hasResourceProperties('AWS::Lambda::Function', {
    Description: 'A Lambda@Edge function for HttpOnly Cookies'
  });
});
```

These are basic examples to get you started. Depending on the complexity and specific configurations of your resources, you might want to extend these tests further to cover more properties or to test other aspects of your infrastructure.

When writing tests for a CDK stack, the goal is to ensure that the stack creates the resources you expect with the configurations you specify. These tests can serve as a form of documentation for your infrastructure and help catch misconfigurations early in the development process.

How do I create the authentiction enpoints, and i think I need S3 user log endpoints for saving and getting the logs.

---

**Codeium** _at 12:44 pm, Jun 28, 2024_

To create authentication endpoints and S3 user log endpoints within your AWS infrastructure using API Gateway, Lambda functions, and the AWS SDK, you'll follow a series of steps. These steps will guide you through setting up the Lambda functions that interact with AWS Cognito for authentication and Amazon S3 for user logs, and then exposing these functions through API Gateway.

### Authentication Endpoints

1. **Lambda Functions for Authentication:**
   First, you'll need Lambda functions to handle authentication tasks (e.g., sign up, sign in, sign out). Each Lambda function will use the AWS SDK to communicate with Cognito. For example, a simple sign-up function might look like this:

   ```typescript
   const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
   const cognito = new AWS.CognitoIdentityServiceProvider({region: 'us-east-1'});

   exports.handler = async (event) => {
     const {username, password, email} = JSON.parse(event.body);

     var params = {
       ClientId: 'YOUR_COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_ID',
       Username: username,
       Password: password,
       UserAttributes: [
         {
           Name: 'email',
           Value: email
         },
       ],
     };

     try {
       const data = await cognito.signUp(params).promise();
       return { statusCode: 200, body: JSON.stringify(data) };
     } catch (err) {
       return { statusCode: 400, body: JSON.stringify(err.message) };
     }
   };
   ```

2. **API Gateway Endpoints:**
   Next, you'll expose these Lambda functions as HTTP endpoints using API Gateway. You can create a new `apigateway.LambdaIntegration` for each Lambda function and then add methods (GET, POST) to resources representing your endpoints.

   ```typescript
   const signUpLambda = new lambda.Function(this, 'SignUpFunction', {
     runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_14_X,
     handler: 'signUp.handler',
     code: lambda.Code.fromAsset('path/to/your/lambda/code'),
   });

   const signUpIntegration = new apigateway.LambdaIntegration(signUpLambda);
   const api = new apigateway.RestApi(this, 'AuthenticationApi');
   const signUpResource = api.root.addResource('signup');
   signUpResource.addMethod('POST', signUpIntegration);
   ```

### S3 User Log Endpoints

For saving and retrieving user logs stored in S3, you'll follow a similar approach but with Lambda functions interacting with the S3 service.

1. **Lambda Function for Saving Logs:**
   This function will receive log data via an API Gateway POST request and save it to an S3 bucket.

   ```typescript
   const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
   const s3 = new AWS.S3();

   exports.handler = async (event) => {
     const { logData, userId } = JSON.parse(event.body); // Example payload
     const bucketName = 'your-s3-bucket-for-logs';

     try {
       await s3.putObject({
         Bucket: bucketName,
         Key: `logs/${userId}/${Date.now()}.txt`,
         Body: logData,
       }).promise();

       return { statusCode: 200, body: JSON.stringify({message: 'Log saved'}) };
     } catch (err) {
       return { statusCode: 500, body: JSON.stringify(err) };
     }
   };
   ```

2. **Lambda Function for Retrieving Logs:**
   Similarly, another Lambda function can list or retrieve logs from S3 for a given user.

3. **API Gateway Integration:**
   Finally, create API Gateway resources and methods for these Lambda functions, just like you did for the authentication endpoints.

### Additional Considerations

- **Security:** Ensure that these endpoints are secure. Use API Gateway's authorizers to protect your endpoints. For user-specific actions, validate that the requester has the necessary permissions.
- **IAM Roles:** Lambda functions interacting with Cognito and S3 need appropriate IAM permissions. Attach policies to the Lambda execution role allowing actions on Cognito and S3 resources.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling in your Lambda functions to gracefully handle and respond to failures.
- **CORS:** If your React app is served from a different domain, ensure that your API Gateway endpoints are configured to support CORS.

By following these steps, you can create a backend system that supports authentication via Cognito and logs management with S3, with HTTP endpoints accessible from your React application.

Organizing your file structure for a project that includes AWS CDK for infrastructure as code (IaC) and AWS Lambda functions for business logic can help in maintaining clear separation of concerns and scalability. Here's a suggested structure based on your current setup and the needs for authentication and log management:

```
/your-project-root
  /cdk
    /bin
      - cdk.ts                # Entry point for CDK app
    /lib
      - cdk-stack.ts          # CDK stack definition
    /lambda                   # Folder for all Lambda function code
      /handtermEdgeFunction
        - app.ts              # Your current Lambda@Edge function for HttpOnly cookies
      /authentication         # Folder for authentication-related Lambda functions
        - signUp.ts           # Lambda function for signing up users
        - signIn.ts           # Lambda function for signing in users
        - signOut.ts          # Lambda function for signing out users
      /userLogs               # Folder for user log-related Lambda functions
        - saveLog.ts          # Lambda function for saving logs to S3
        - getLog.ts           # Lambda function for retrieving logs from S3
    - cdk.json                # CDK configuration
    - package.json            # NPM package file for CDK dependencies and scripts
    - tsconfig.json           # TypeScript config for the CDK project
  /src                        # Your React application source code
    /components               # React components
    /hooks                    # React custom hooks, e.g., useAuth
    - App.tsx                 # Main React application file
    - index.tsx               # Entry point for React app
  /test                       # Folder for tests
    - cdk.test.ts             # Tests for your CDK infrastructure
  - package.json              # NPM package file for your project's root, could include scripts for deploying CDK, starting React app, etc.
  - tsconfig.json             # TypeScript config for the root of your project
```

### Explanation

- **/cdk**: This directory contains all your AWS CDK-related code. It is separate from your application code, making it clear that this code defines infrastructure.

  - **/bin/cdk.ts**: Entry point for the CDK application. It initializes the CDK app and stack.
  - **/lib/cdk-stack.ts**: Defines your AWS infrastructure using CDK constructs (e.g., Lambda functions, API Gateway, S3 buckets).
  - **/lambda**: Contains the source code for all your Lambda functions. Organizing Lambda functions into subdirectories (e.g., `/authentication`, `/userLogs`) based on their purpose helps maintain clarity.

- **/src**: Contains your React application code. This separation ensures that application logic and frontend code are decoupled from infrastructure code.

- **/test**: Contains tests for your infrastructure as code. This could include unit tests for your CDK constructs and integration tests.

This structure supports scalability and separation of concerns, allowing you to manage your frontend application, backend logic, and infrastructure code efficiently. It also facilitates easier navigation and maintenance as your project grows.

I have `saveLog` like this:

```ts
// cdk/lambda/userStorage/saveLog.ts

const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
const s3 = new AWS.S3();

exports.handler = async (event) => {
  const { logData, userId } = JSON.parse(event.body); // Example payload
  const bucketName = 'handterm';

  try {
    await s3.putObject({
      Bucket: bucketName,
      Key: `logs/${userId}/${Date.now()}.txt`,
      Body: logData,
    }).promise();

    return { statusCode: 200, body: JSON.stringify({ message: 'Log saved' }) };
  } catch (err) {
    return { statusCode: 500, body: JSON.stringify(err) };
  }
};
```

But it says 

```ts
Cannot redeclare block-scoped variable 'AWS'.ts(2451)
getLog.ts(2, 7): 'AWS' was also declared here.
```

The error message you're encountering, `Cannot redeclare block-scoped variable 'AWS'`, suggests that there's a conflict in your TypeScript project due to the `AWS` variable being declared in more than one file in a way that TypeScript considers them to be in the same scope. This usually happens in TypeScript projects where the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) treats all files in the project (or within specified directories in `tsconfig.json`) as part of a single compilation context, and thus, global variables can conflict.

This issue is common when using CommonJS-style imports (`require`) in a TypeScript project without proper module isolation. Here are a few ways to resolve this issue:

### Solution 1: Ensure Files Are Treated as Modules
Make sure each TypeScript file is treated as a module by adding an `export` or `import` statement (other than `require`). In TypeScript, a file is considered a module if it contains at least one `import` or `export` statement. This encapsulates the variables within the module scope, preventing them from clashing with declarations in other files.

Since you're already using `exports.handler`, your file should be treated as a module. However, the error suggests that TypeScript isn't treating your files as separate modules for some reason.

### Solution 2: Use ES6 Imports
Switch to using ES6-style imports, which might help TypeScript better recognize file boundaries as module boundaries:

```typescript
import * as AWS from 'aws-sdk';

const s3 = new AWS.S3();

exports.handler = async (event) => {
  // Your code...
};
```

This change makes the syntax more consistent with typical TypeScript usage and can help avoid scoping issues.

### Solution 3: Check TypeScript Configuration
Make sure your `tsconfig.json` is correctly configured for a Node.js environment, especially if you're mixing client-side and server-side code in the same project. For a Node.js project, your `tsconfig.json` might include:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "CommonJS",
    "target": "ES2018",
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    // Other options...
  },
  "include": [
    "cdk/**/*"
  ],
  "exclude": [
    "node_modules",
    // other folders to exclude
  ]
}
```

Ensure the `include` and `exclude` sections correctly define what directories or files should be part of the compilation context.

### Solution 4: Isolate Serverless Function Code
If you have serverless functions (like Lambda functions) and other parts of your application (like a React frontend) in the same TypeScript project, consider isolating them into separate directories with their own `tsconfig.json` files or even separate projects if the issue persists. This can help ensure the compiler settings optimal for one part don't interfere with another.

### Review Project Structure
If the issue remains unresolved, review your project structure and `tsconfig.json` settings to ensure there's no unintended global scope pollution happening due to misconfiguration.

**User** _at 1:22 pm, Jun 28, 2024_

Regarding your first suggestion, I don't seem to be able to export the `exports.handler`.

Can you explain how I would implement your suggestion?

---

**Codeium** _at 1:23 pm, Jun 28, 2024_

Certainly! To clarify my first suggestion, the goal is to ensure your TypeScript file is treated as a module, which you're likely already doing if you're using `exports.handler`. My initial explanation might have been a bit confusing by implying changes to `exports.handler`, which wasn't necessary. The main focus should be on ensuring TypeScript recognizes your file as a module to prevent scope issues.

Given that you're facing issues with redeclaration when using CommonJS-style `require`, let's dive into how you can use ES6-style imports and exports in your TypeScript project. This approach inherently treats each file as a module.

### Convert `require` to ES6 `import`

First, convert the CommonJS `require` to an ES6 `import` statement. This change not only aligns with TypeScript best practices but also helps ensure that each file is treated as a module.

Original CommonJS `require`:
```typescript
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
```

Converted to ES6 `import`:
```typescript
import * as AWS from 'aws-sdk';
```

### Update the AWS S3 Initialization

Original initialization:
```typescript
const s3 = new AWS.S3();
```

This remains unchanged after converting to ES6-style imports.

### Exporting the Handler Function

Your handler function can remain as it is, using `exports` to make it available for AWS Lambda to execute:

```typescript
exports.handler = async (event) => {
  // Your Lambda function code...
};
```

However, if you wish to fully embrace ES6 syntax, you can also use the `export` keyword directly:

```typescript
export const handler = async (event) => {
  // Your Lambda function code...
};
```

### Full Example with ES6 Syntax

Here's how your `saveLog.ts` could look after applying ES6 imports and optionally changing the export style:

```typescript
// Using ES6 imports
import * as AWS from 'aws-sdk';

const s3 = new AWS.S3();

// Keeping the CommonJS export style
exports.handler = async (event) => {
  const { logData, userId } = JSON.parse(event.body);
  const bucketName = 'handterm';

  try {
    await s3.putObject({
      Bucket: bucketName,
      Key: `logs/${userId}/${Date.now()}.txt`,
      Body: logData,
    }).promise();

    return { statusCode: 200, body: JSON.stringify({ message: 'Log saved' }) };
  } catch (err) {
    return { statusCode: 500, body: JSON.stringify(err) };
  }
};

// Or using ES6 export style
// export const handler = async (event) => { ... };
```

### Ensuring TypeScript Configuration

Make sure your `tsconfig.json` is correctly set up for ES6 modules:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2018",
    "module": "CommonJS",
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "moduleResolution": "node"
  }
}
```

- `"module": "CommonJS"`: Even though you're using ES6 `import`/`export`, this setting is for the output module system. Node.js uses CommonJS, so this setting ensures compatibility.
- `"esModuleInterop": true`: Allows default imports from modules with no default export. This setting helps when importing modules like `aws-sdk`.

By following these steps, you ensure each file is treated as a module, mitigating scope pollution issues and aligning with TypeScript best practices.

When I have made these updates and I want to test, do I have to `yarn build` and then `cdk deploy` in order to `yarn test`?

---

**Codeium** _at 1:33 pm, Jun 28, 2024_

When incorporating changes into your AWS CDK project and Lambda function code, your development and testing workflow typically involves several steps. Here's a general approach to follow after making updates:

### 1. Building and Testing the CDK Project

- **`yarn build` or `npm run build`**: This step compiles your TypeScript CDK code (including any Lambda functions you have within your CDK project if they're also written in TypeScript) to JavaScript. This step is necessary because AWS Lambda runs JavaScript code, and the CDK needs to synthesize your infrastructure into a CloudFormation template, which is done based on the compiled JavaScript code.

- **Local Tests**: Before deploying your changes to AWS, you might want to run local tests, especially for your Lambda functions. For Lambda functions, you can use tools like AWS SAM CLI or lambda-local to test your functions locally. For CDK constructs, you can write unit tests using the AWS CDK's `@aws-cdk/assert` library.

- **`yarn test` or `npm run test`**: Runs tests you've written for your CDK constructs or any other part of your project. This command doesn't require a build or deploy to AWS to be executed. It's focused on running any automated tests (e.g., unit tests) you have within your project. Ensure your tests are designed to be runnable in your local environment without needing the actual AWS environment.

### 2. Deploying to AWS

- **`cdk deploy`**: This command synthesizes your CDK app to a CloudFormation template and deploys it to AWS, creating or updating resources as defined in your CDK app. This step requires the previous `yarn build` or `npm run build` to compile your TypeScript code. It's important to deploy your changes to AWS to test them in an environment that closely resembles production.

  - Ensure you've built your project with `yarn build` or `npm run build` before this step if you've made changes to the TypeScript files.
  - You might not need to redeploy your entire CDK stack if only Lambda function code has changed. You can use tools like AWS SAM CLI for faster iteration on Lambda functions.

### 3. End-to-End and Integration Testing

After deploying your changes with `cdk deploy`, you might want to run end-to-end tests or integration tests that interact with the deployed resources. These tests usually require the infrastructure to be deployed and accessible.

### Summary

- **For local tests** (e.g., unit tests for your Lambda functions or CDK constructs), you do not need to `cdk deploy`. Just ensure your code is compiled with `yarn build` or `npm run build`, and then run `yarn test` or `npm run test`.
- **For integration or end-to-end tests** that require interaction with AWS resources, run `cdk deploy` after building your project to apply your changes, and then perform your tests against the deployed resources.

This workflow ensures that your code is tested at multiple levels, from unit testing to integration testing, before being fully deployed or integrated into your production environment.

**User** _at 1:36 pm, Jun 28, 2024_

I would like to know more about your suggestion to use AWS SAM CLI. How would I use that in this CDK project?

---

**Codeium** _at 1:37 pm, Jun 28, 2024_

Integrating AWS SAM CLI with an AWS CDK project for local testing, especially for Lambda functions, involves a few steps. AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model) is a framework for building serverless applications that makes it easier to locally test Lambda functions, API Gateway APIs, and other AWS services. However, using SAM directly with a CDK project isn't straightforward because SAM works with SAM/CloudFormation templates, while CDK projects use CDK constructs to define resources.

Here’s how you can approach local testing of Lambda functions within a CDK project:

### 1. Export Lambda Function Definitions as CloudFormation Outputs

For each Lambda function in your CDK stack that you want to test locally using SAM, you'll need to explicitly export the function's ARN (Amazon Resource Name) as a CloudFormation output. This makes it easier to retrieve the function's details after deployment.

In your `cdk-stack.ts`:

```typescript
new cdk.CfnOutput(this, 'MyFunctionArn', {
  value: myLambdaFunction.functionArn,
});
```

### 2. Deploy Your CDK Stack

Deploy your CDK stack to AWS as usual. This step is necessary because you'll need the deployed resources to be available in AWS for SAM to reference them.

```bash
cdk deploy
```

### 3. Retrieve Deployed Lambda Function ARN

After deployment, retrieve the ARN of the Lambda function you exported. You can find this in the CloudFormation console under the "Outputs" tab of your stack or by using the AWS CLI.

### 4. Install and Configure AWS SAM CLI

If you haven't already, install the AWS SAM CLI according to the [official installation instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html).

### 5. Create a SAM Template for Local Testing

Create a SAM template (`template.yaml`) that defines the resources you want to test locally. You can manually create this file based on the resources in your CDK stack. For Lambda functions, you can reference the existing function by its ARN or set up a local source path.

Here’s an example `template.yaml` for a Lambda function:

```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Transform: AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31
Resources:
  MyLambdaFunction:
    Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
    Properties:
      Handler: lambda_function.lambda_handler
      Runtime: python3.8
      CodeUri: ./path/to/your/lambda/code/
```

For Lambda functions already deployed, you might want to use the `AWS::Lambda::Function` resource type and reference the ARN directly or focus on testing new functions locally.

### 6. Use SAM CLI to Invoke Your Lambda Function Locally

With the SAM template in place, use SAM CLI to invoke your Lambda function locally:

```bash
sam local invoke "MyLambdaFunction" -e event.json
```

Here, `event.json` is a file containing input data passed to the Lambda function during the invocation.

### 7. Debugging

SAM CLI also supports local debugging. Depending on your IDE, you can start the Lambda function in debug mode and attach the debugger to it.

### Limitations and Considerations

- This workflow is more manual compared to directly deploying and testing in AWS because CDK and SAM serve slightly different purposes and have different models for defining infrastructure.
- For complex applications or when you frequently modify Lambda functions, consider structuring your project to make Lambda development and testing more efficient, possibly by using SAM for the serverless components and CDK for broader infrastructure needs.
- Keep in mind that this approach is primarily for Lambda functions. Testing other resources (e.g., API Gateway, DynamoDB) locally with SAM might require additional setup or mocking.

Using SAM CLI with a CDK project is beneficial for local Lambda function testing, but it requires careful setup and management. Consider your project's needs and complexity to choose the best approach for local development and testing.

**User** _at 1:58 pm, Jun 28, 2024_

I think some of these values are supposed to be stored in my `cdk/.env` file, rather than hard-coded.

```ts
 var params = {
  ClientId: '20v05sjujvqnakhu8ps0jk2p7u',
  Username: username,
  Password: password,
  UserAttributes: [
   {
    Name: 'email',
    Value: email
   },
  ],
 };

```

How can I use the `.env` file locally but also have the same value put into the environment variables in the AWS Lambda function?

Also, is there any way for me to create the test values that will be used in the test environment in the Lambda function in the AWS web console?

---

**Codeium** _at 1:59 pm, Jun 28, 2024_

To use environment variables both locally and in AWS Lambda functions, and to manage test values in a test environment, you can follow these steps:

### 1. Using `.env` File Locally

For local development, you can use the `dotenv` package to load environment variables from a `.env` file into your Node.js application.

- **Install `dotenv`**: If you haven't already, add `dotenv` to your project:

```bash
npm install dotenv
```

- **Create a `.env` File**: In your `cdk` directory (or the root of your project), create a `.env` file with your environment variables:

```
CLIENT_ID=20v05sjujvqnakhu8ps0jk2p7u
```

- **Load Environment Variables**: At the beginning of your Node.js script (e.g., in your Lambda function code if you're invoking it locally for testing), load the environment variables:

```typescript
require('dotenv').config();

// Now you can access process.env.CLIENT_ID
```

### 2. Setting Environment Variables in AWS Lambda

To use the same environment variables in your AWS Lambda functions:

- **CDK Code**: When you're defining your Lambda function with CDK, you can specify environment variables:

```typescript
new lambda.Function(this, 'MyFunction', {
  runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_14_X,
  handler: 'function.handler',
  code: lambda.Code.fromAsset('path/to/your/code'),
  environment: {
    CLIENT_ID: process.env.CLIENT_ID, // Assuming you've set this in your shell or CI/CD environment
  }
});
```

- **AWS Console**: You can also manually set environment variables for a Lambda function in the AWS Management Console:
  - Open the Lambda function you want to configure.
  - Scroll down to the "Environment variables" section.
  - Click "Edit" and add your environment variables (e.g., `CLIENT_ID` with its value).

### 3. Managing Test Values in Lambda Test Events

For testing Lambda functions with specific values, you can create test events directly in the AWS Lambda console:

- **AWS Console**:
  - Open your Lambda function in the AWS Lambda console.
  - In the "Test" tab, you can configure a new test event.
  - Create a JSON object with the structure expected by your function. For example:

```json
{
  "body": "{\"username\":\"testUser\",\"password\":\"testPass\",\"email\":\"test@example.com\"}"
}
```

- Save the test event with a meaningful name. You can now use this test event to invoke your Lambda function with the specific test values.

### 4. CI/CD Environment Variables

For continuous integration and deployment, you'll want to ensure that environment variables like `CLIENT_ID` are securely stored and accessible in your CI/CD pipeline. Most CI/CD platforms allow you to set environment variables that can be used during the build and deployment processes.

- **GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, AWS CodeBuild, etc.**: Look for the documentation on how to set environment variables in your specific CI/CD system.

By following these practices, you can maintain consistency between your local development environment, test environment, and production environment, ensuring that your application behaves the same way across all stages.

The output from your `cdk deploy` command provides crucial information that explains why you're not seeing the `HandTermCdkStack` in the AWS CloudFormation page for the `us-east-1` region. The key detail is in the output lines towards the end, which include URLs and ARNs that reference the `us-west-2` region. For example:

- `HandTermCdkStack.ApiEndpoint = https://pvy2guu1n5.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/`
- `HandTermCdkStack.IdentityPoolId = us-west-2:a9dea5bb-5aab-4f15-b6ef-a044c27e3310`
- `HandTermCdkStack.UserPoolId = us-west-2_u6JOIezmY`
- `arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:318364255844:stack/HandTermCdkStack/75308640-3568-11ef-85b4-0209cdc4ef6b`

These lines clearly indicate that the stack was deployed in the `us-west-2` region, not `us-east-1` as intended. This discrepancy is why you are unable to find the stack in the CloudFormation console for `us-east-1`.

The reason for this might be an oversight in the command, a default region setting in your AWS profile (`mark`), or a region specification in your CDK code that overrides the command line parameter.

### How to Fix:

1. **Check AWS Profile Configuration**: Ensure that the AWS profile (`mark`) you used for deployment doesn't have `us-west-2` set as its default region. You can check and change this in the AWS credentials file, usually located at `~/.aws/config` or `%UserProfile%\.aws\config` on Windows.

2. **Review CDK Code for Region Specifications**: If your CDK code explicitly sets the region to `us-west-2` for any resources or the stack itself, it will override the command line parameter. Review your `cdk-stack.ts` or any relevant CDK code to see if the region is set explicitly.

3. **Redeploy with Correct Region**: If you intended to deploy to `us-east-1`, ensure that your AWS CLI, CDK code, and AWS profile settings are all aligned with this intention. You might explicitly set the region in your `cdk deploy` command and double-check the other configurations:
   
   ```powersell
   cdk deploy --region us-east-1 --profile mark
   ```

4. **Access the Correct Region in AWS Management Console**: If you're looking to work with the resources as they are now, you'll need to switch to the `us-west-2` region in the AWS Management Console to find your deployed `HandTermCdkStack`.

5. **Update Your Resource References**: If moving resources or redeploying, ensure that any region-specific references in your code or infrastructure setup are updated accordingly.

6. **Cleanup**: If you have resources deployed in an unintended region (`us-west-2`), remember to clean them up if they're not needed to avoid unnecessary charges. Use `cdk destroy` or manually delete the resources through the AWS Management Console.

By following these steps, you should be able to locate your stack in the correct region or redeploy it to the intended region.

I already posted the command I used in the message above which clearly states:

So that command clearly does not say `us-west-2` because it says `us-east-`, so that suggestion does not apply ot the case at hand.

You're correct, and I appreciate your patience. Given that your command specifies `--region us-east-1`, but the deployment occurred in `us-west-2`, let's explore other factors that might have influenced the deployment region:

1. **CDK Context and Configuration**:
   - CDK might use region information from several sources, including the `cdk.json` configuration file, context values passed at runtime, or environment variables. Check your `cdk.json` for any default region settings that could override command-line arguments. Also, review any environment variables (`AWS_REGION`, `CDK_DEFAULT_REGION`) that might affect the deployment.

2. **Profile Region Configuration**:
   - Despite the command line specifying `--region us-east-1`, if the `mark` profile has a default region configured that differs from the command line, it typically shouldn't override the explicit command-line argument. However, it's worth double-checking the profile settings in `~/.aws/config` or `%UserProfile%\.aws\config` to ensure there's no misconfiguration.

3. **CDK Code Explicit Region Specification**:
   - Review your CDK stack code to see if the region is hardcoded in any resource or stack definitions. Although specifying `--region` in the `cdk deploy` command should dictate the deployment region, a hardcoded region in the code could potentially lead to unexpected behaviors.

4. **AWS CLI and CDK CLI Versions**:
   - Ensure your AWS CLI and CDK CLI are up to date. An outdated CLI tool might contain bugs or not fully support certain command-line arguments as expected. Update both CLIs to their latest versions and try the deployment again.

```bash
npm update -g aws-cdk
pip install --upgrade awscli
```

5. **Debugging the Deployment Command**:
   - Use additional logging to see if there's more information on why the region might be set incorrectly. You can set the `CDK_DEBUG=true` environment variable to get more verbose output during the deployment process.

```powershell
$env:CDK_DEBUG="true"; cdk deploy --region us-east-1 --profile mark
```

6. **Inspecting the Deployed Stack**:
   - After deployment, using the AWS CLI, inspect the stack to confirm the region it's been deployed to with the following command:

```bash
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name HandTermCdkStack --profile mark --region us-west-2
```

Replace `--region us-west-2` with other regions if you're checking for the stack's presence elsewhere.

Given the discrepancy in the expected vs. actual deployment region, and considering your command was correctly specified, it suggests the issue likely lies within the configuration or state that wasn't overridden by the command-line argument. Reviewing and debugging with the above suggestions should help identify the cause.

I have successfully deployed to `us-east-1` and now I would like to start testing authentication from the `useAuth`

---

**Codeium** _at 3:30 pm, Jun 28, 2024_

To start testing the authentication functionality implemented in your `useAuth` custom React hook, you'll want to follow a structured approach that covers various aspects of the authentication flow, such as signing up, signing in, and signing out users. Given that your authentication setup likely involves interaction with AWS Cognito (based on the context from your deployment outputs), here's how you can start testing:

### 1. **Setup Test Environment**

Ensure that your React application's environment is correctly configured for testing. This includes setting up any environment variables required for interacting with the AWS Cognito service, such as the User Pool ID and Client ID, in your testing environment.

### 2. **Unit Testing**

For unit testing in React, especially when testing hooks, you can use tools like Jest and the React Testing Library. These tools provide a powerful and flexible way to write tests that mimic real-world usage of your hooks.

- **Install Dependencies**:

If you haven't already, install the necessary testing libraries:

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/react-hooks
```

- **Mocking Modules**:

Since `useAuth` likely makes HTTP requests (e.g., to AWS Cognito), you'll want to mock these requests to avoid actual API calls during testing. Jest provides a straightforward way to mock modules:

```javascript
jest.mock('axios');
```

- **Testing the Hook**:

Use the `renderHook` method from `@testing-library/react-hooks` to test your hook in isolation. For example, to test a login function in `useAuth`, you could write a test case like this:

```javascript
import { renderHook, act } from '@testing-library/react-hooks';
import useAuth from './useAuth'; // Adjust the import path according to your project structure

test('should allow a user to log in', async () => {
  const { result, waitForNextUpdate } = renderHook(() => useAuth());

  act(() => {
    result.current.login({ username: 'test', password: 'password' });
  });

  await waitForNextUpdate();

  expect(result.current.isLoggedIn).toBe(true);
});
```

This is a simplified example. Your actual test will depend on how `useAuth` is implemented, especially around handling asynchronous operations.

### 3. **Integration Testing**

Integration testing involves testing the interaction between different parts of your application, such as the `useAuth` hook and the components that use it.

- **Simulating User Interaction**:

With the help of `@testing-library/react`, you can simulate user interactions (e.g., filling out a login form and submitting it) and assert the expected outcomes, such as the change in authentication state or the rendering of authenticated user interfaces.

### 4. **End-to-End Testing**

For end-to-end testing, consider using a tool like Cypress. This allows you to test your application's authentication flow in a real browser, interacting with the actual AWS Cognito service in a test environment.

- **Cypress Test for Authentication**:

You can write a Cypress test that navigates to your login page, enters credentials, submits the form, and then asserts that the authentication was successful based on the presence of certain elements on the page.

### 5. **Testing Environment Considerations**

When testing against AWS Cognito:

- Use a separate Cognito User Pool for testing to avoid polluting your production user data.
- Consider pre-creating test users or automating user creation and teardown as part of your test setup and teardown processes.

By following these steps, you can comprehensively test your `useAuth` hook and ensure that your application's authentication flow works as expected.

For end-to-end testing I would like to use an `.http` file.

I believe the `.http` Rest Client provides use of a `{ dotenv }` type of syntax to pull values from the `.env` file and execute HTTP actions against a url.

---

**Codeium** _at 3:48 pm, Jun 28, 2024_

Yes, you're correct! The `.http` file format is used by REST Client, a popular extension for Visual Studio Code that allows you to send HTTP requests and view responses directly within VS Code. It supports using environment variables from a `.env` file, enabling you to keep sensitive information, like API keys or URLs, out of your `.http` files. This feature is very useful for end-to-end testing, as it allows you to dynamically configure your HTTP requests based on your environment.

### Setting Up `.env` File for REST Client

1. **Create a `.env` File**: In your project, create a `.env` file if you haven't already. This file will store environment-specific variables.

```plaintext
# .env
API_URL=https://pvy2guu1n5.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/
COGNITO_CLIENT_ID=your_cognito_client_id_here
```

2. **Referencing Environment Variables in `.http` Files**: In your `.http` files, you can reference these environment variables using the `{{variable_name}}` syntax.

```http
### Sign Up
POST {{API_URL}}/signup HTTP/1.1
content-type: application/json

{
  "username": "testuser",
  "password": "TestPassword1!",
  "email": "testuser@example.com"
}

### Sign In
POST {{API_URL}}/signin HTTP/1.1
content-type: application/json

{
  "username": "testuser",
  "password": "TestPassword1!"
}
```

### Using `.env` Variables in REST Client

To make REST Client aware of your `.env` variables, you need to:

1. **Install REST Client Extension**: Make sure you have the REST Client extension installed in your Visual Studio Code.

2. **Configure REST Client to Use `.env`**: By default, REST Client automatically recognizes `.env` files located at the root of your workspace. If your `.env` file is in a different location, or if you wish to specify a custom environment file, you can configure this in the `.vscode/settings.json` file of your workspace:

```json
{
  "rest-client.environmentVariables": {
    "$shared": {
      "API_URL": "https://pvy2guu1n5.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/",
      "COGNITO_CLIENT_ID": "your_cognito_client_id_here"
    }
  }
}
```

This approach allows you to keep your workspace settings and environment variables in sync.

### Additional Tips for End-to-End Testing

- **Security**: Be cautious with sensitive information. Avoid committing `.env` files with sensitive data to your version control system. Use `.env.example` as a template for required variables without revealing actual sensitive values.
- **Testing Different Environments**: You can create multiple `.env` files (e.g., `.env.testing`, `.env.production`) for different environments and switch between them as needed by renaming the desired file to `.env` or by changing the REST Client configuration in `.vscode/settings.json`.
- **Automating Tests**: While `.http` files are great for manual testing and exploration, consider using a tool like Postman, Newman, or a custom script for automated end-to-end testing, especially as part of a CI/CD pipeline.

Using `.http` files with dynamic environment variables offers a flexible and efficient way to test your application's endpoints, making it easier to manage and execute tests across different environments.

I had to update the syntax slightly:

```http

"User pool client YOUR_COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_ID does not exist."

```

Don't we need to perform some kind of multi-step token swap?

**Codeium** _at 4:12 pm, Jun 28, 2024_

The error message you're encountering, `"User pool client YOUR_COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_ID does not exist."`, suggests that the `COGNITO_CLIENT_ID` variable is not being correctly replaced with its actual value from your `.env` file. This might happen if the variable isn't correctly defined or if there's a mistake in how it's referenced in the `.http` file.

Given that you've corrected the syntax to use `{{ $dotenv API_URL}}`, ensure you're also correctly referencing the `COGNITO_CLIENT_ID` in the same manner. However, based on your message, it seems there might not have been a direct reference to `COGNITO_CLIENT_ID` in the provided `.http` snippet. If your API requires the Cognito App Client ID to be sent as part of the request (for example, as a header or within the request body), make sure it is correctly included and referenced in your `.http` file:

```http
### Sign Up
POST {{ $dotenv API_URL }}/signup HTTP/1.1
content-type: application/json

{
 "clientId": "{{ $dotenv COGNITO_CLIENT_ID }}",
 "username": "testuser",
 "password": "TestPassword1!",
 "email": "testuser@example.com"
}
```

Make sure that your `.env` file contains the correct `COGNITO_CLIENT_ID` value:

```env
COGNITO_CLIENT_ID=actual_cognito_client_id_here
```

Regarding the multi-step token swap you mentioned, AWS Cognito authentication typically involves several steps, especially when implementing custom authentication flows or integrating with external identity providers. The basic flow would be:

1. **Sign-Up**: Register the user. This step could involve verifying the email or phone number.
2. **Sign-In**: Authenticate the user and receive tokens (ID token, access token, and refresh token).
3. **Token Use**: Use the ID token to access your backend or use the access token to interact with AWS services.
4. **Token Refresh**: When the ID token and access token expire, use the refresh token to obtain new tokens.

In your case, if the signup is successful and you're looking to perform further authenticated actions, you would typically proceed to sign in the user, which involves submitting the username and password and receiving tokens in response. Here's a hypothetical example of what the sign-in request might look like:

```http
### Sign In
POST {{ $dotenv API_URL }}/signin HTTP/1.1
content-type: application/json

{
 "clientId": "{{ $dotenv COGNITO_CLIENT_ID }}",
 "username": "testuser",
 "password": "TestPassword1!"
}
```

After successfully signing in, you would use the received tokens for authenticated requests or actions as required by your application's authentication design.

If these steps are not matching exactly what you need to do based on your backend setup, please adjust the request details accordingly. Also, ensure that your backend correctly interprets and validates the tokens received from Cognito.
