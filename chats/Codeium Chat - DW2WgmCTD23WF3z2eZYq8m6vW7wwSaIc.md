I need your assistance in creating these two forms of documentation for this project:

1. Component Hierarchy Tree: A simple tree diagram that represents the nesting of components. This can be done using indented lists or any tree diagram tool.

2. Props & State Table: Document each component with a table listing its props and state, including types and descriptions. This is essential for TypeScript projects to ensure type safety and clarity.

---

**Codeium** _at 11:31 pm, Jun 15, 2024_

Based on the provided context, I can help you outline a basic structure for both the Component Hierarchy Tree and the Props & State Table. However, I'll need you to fill in or confirm specifics, as my knowledge of the entire component structure and all props and state is limited.

### 1. Component Hierarchy Tree

The component hierarchy tree represents the nesting of components. Here's a simple indented list representing the hierarchy based on the context provided:

```
HandTerm
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Output
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TerminalGame
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ScrollingTextLayer
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ParallaxLayer
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Hero
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Zombie4
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ NextCharsDisplay
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ XtermAdapter
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ WebCam (Referenced in code, but hierarchy position is unclear)
```

_Note: The actual tree for your project may have more components or different nesting. Update this structure to accurately reflect your project._

### 2. Props & State Table

For the props and state table, you can create a table for each component that lists its props and state with types and descriptions. Here's a template and example based on the context provided:

#### HandTerm Component

| Type | Name               | Data Type                           | Description                                       |
|------|--------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Prop | terminalWidth      | number                              | The width of the terminal set by the parent.      |
| State | commandLine       | string                              | Input command line text.                          |
| State | heroAction        | ActionType                          | Current action of the hero character.             |
| ...  | ...                | ...                                 | ...                                               |

#### TerminalGame Component

| Type | Name               | Data Type                           | Description                                       |
|------|--------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Prop | canvasHeight       | number                              | The height of the canvas used in the game.        |
| Prop | heroActionType     | ActionType                          | Current action of the hero character.             |
| ...  | ...                | ...                                 | ...                                               |

#### Other Components

Create similar tables for `Output`, `NextCharsDisplay`, `XtermAdapter`, `Hero`, `Zombie4`, and any other components that have props and/or state.

Please note that you'll need to complete these tables with the actual props and state from your components. The tables above are just starting points based on the limited context provided. Make sure to go through each component file to document all the props and state variables.

**User** _at 10:12 am, Jun 16, 2024_

Are there any command-line tools that can output the component hierarchy and props and state tables?

---

**Codeium** _at 10:13 am, Jun 16, 2024_

Yes, there are several command-line tools that can help analyze and output the component hierarchy and props and state tables for React applications. Here are a few that might be useful for your TypeScript project:

1. **React Docgen**: This tool can parse your React components and extract information like props, descriptions, and default values. It supports TypeScript and can generate documentation in various formats.

   Installation:
   ```bash
   npm install -g react-docgen
   ```
   
   Usage:
   ```bash
   react-docgen src/components/MyComponent.tsx -o component-docs.json
   ```
   
   This will output documentation for `MyComponent.tsx` to a JSON file.

2. **TypeDoc**: TypeDoc is a documentation generator for TypeScript projects. It can create comprehensive documentation by examining your TypeScript source files.

   Installation:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev typedoc
   ```
   
   Usage:
   ```bash
   npx typedoc --out docs src
   ```
   
   This command will generate documentation for your entire `src` directory and output it to the `docs` folder.

3. **React Styleguidist**: This tool provides a live style guide for your components, showing the component hierarchy, props, and examples. It can parse both TypeScript and PropTypes.

   Installation:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev react-styleguidist
   ```
   
   Usage:
   ```bash
   npx styleguidist server
   ```
   
   This will start a development server that displays a style guide based on your components.

4. **Storybook**: While not strictly a command-line tool, Storybook acts as an interactive UI component explorer. It can show your component hierarchy and allows you to document props as well.

   Installation:
   ```bash
   npx sb init
   ```
   
   Usage:
   ```bash
   npm run storybook
   ```
   
   This will start the Storybook interface where you can explore and document your components.

Each of these tools requires some configuration to match your project setup. They may also need additional plugins or settings to fully support TypeScript. Be sure to check the documentation for each tool to configure it for your project's needs.

I am in PowerShell on windows and after installing `react-docgen` I get this error:

```tsx
üïê[10:37:11]‚ùØ react-docgen src/* -o component-docs.json
react-docgen: The term 'react-docgen' is not recognized as a name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or executable program.
Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.
```

---

**Codeium** _at 10:45 am, Jun 16, 2024_

The error message indicates that PowerShell cannot find the `react-docgen` command. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. **Global Installation Not in PATH**: Even though you've installed `react-docgen` globally, it might not be added to the PATH environment variable.

2. **Local Installation**: If you've installed `react-docgen` locally, you should run it through `npx` or by specifying the full path to the executable in the `node_modules/.bin/` directory.

Here are some steps to resolve the issue:

### Using npx

If you have `npx` installed (it comes with npm 5.2+), you can run `react-docgen` without installing it globally:

```bash
npx react-docgen src/components/* --out-dir ./component-docs
```

### Install Locally and Run

You can install `react-docgen` locally and run it using a script defined in your `package.json`:

```bash
npm install --save-dev react-docgen
```

Add a script in your `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "docgen": "react-docgen src/components/* --out-dir ./component-docs"
}
```

Run the script:

```bash
npm run docgen
```

### Check PATH After Global Installation

If you installed `react-docgen` globally and want to keep using it that way, you should check that the global npm bin directory is in your PATH. 

Find out where global npm executables are stored:

```bash
npm bin -g
```

Ensure that the directory output by the above command is included in your PATH environment variable. If it's not, you can add it manually.

To add it to PATH temporarily, you can use:

```bash
$env:PATH += ";C:\path\to\your\global\npm\bin"
```

Replace `C:\path\to\your\global\npm\bin` with the actual path you got from `npm bin -g`.

To add it permanently, you'll need to edit your environment variables through the Windows system settings.

Once you've resolved the PATH issue, try running `react-docgen` again. If you continue to encounter problems, using the local method with `npx` or npm scripts is a reliable alternative.

It seems that the `react-docgen` executable isn't being recognized correctly by `npx`. This could be due to several reasons, including how `npx` resolves packages or a potential issue with the package itself.

Here are some steps you can try to resolve the issue:

### Try Running with a Specific Package Version

Sometimes, specifying the package version explicitly can help `npx` resolve the correct executable:

```pwsh
npx react-docgen@latest src/components/* --out-dir ./component-docs
```

### Install `react-docgen` Locally

Instead of using `npx` or a global installation, try installing `react-docgen` locally in your project:

```pwsh
npm install --save-dev react-docgen
```

After installing it locally, you can run the command using `npx` (which will look for the local version first):

```pwsh
npx react-docgen src/components/* --out-dir ./component-docs
```

Or add it as a script in your `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "generate-docs": "react-docgen src/components/* --out-dir ./component-docs"
}
```

And then run that script:

```pwsh
npm run generate-docs
```

### Check Your Shell Wildcard Expansion

The use of the wildcard `*` in `src/components/*` might not be working as expected in PowerShell. You can try specifying the files explicitly or using another form of globbing, depending on how your shell expands file paths.

### Verify Your Node and npm Configuration

Since you are using `nvm` on Windows, make sure that the `nvm` is configured correctly and that you are using the right Node.js version. You can check the current Node.js and npm versions with:

```pwsh
node -v
npm -v
```

Ensure that the versions match the ones you expect to use for your project. If you've recently switched Node.js versions with `nvm`, you might need to reinstall global packages.

### Check for Issues with `npx`

There may be an issue with `npx` itself. You can try updating `npm` (which includes `npx`) to the latest version:

```pwsh
npm install -g npm
```

### Review the Debug Log

The debug log you provided suggests an issue with resolving the executable. If none of the above steps work, you may want to search for similar issues with `npx` and `react-docgen` or consider filing an issue on the `react-docgen` repository or relevant forums for further assistance.

**User** _at 10:55 am, Jun 16, 2024_

You said to use this:

```pwsh
npm install --save-dev react-docgen
```

But I am using Yarn. Could that be what is complicating the installation of `react-docgen`?

---

**Codeium** _at 10:55 am, Jun 16, 2024_

Yes, if you're using Yarn, you should use Yarn commands to install packages to ensure compatibility with your project's package manager.

To install `react-docgen` locally with Yarn, use the following command:

```pwsh
yarn add --dev react-docgen
```

After installing it, you can use `yarn` to run the `react-docgen` command:

```pwsh
yarn react-docgen src/components/* --out-dir ./component-docs
```

Alternatively, you can add a script to your `package.json` like this:

```json
"scripts": {
  "generate-docs": "react-docgen src/components/* --out-dir ./component-docs"
}
```

And then run the script with Yarn:

```pwsh
yarn generate-docs
```

Using Yarn consistently for your package management will avoid issues that might arise from mixing package managers, such as `npm` and `Yarn`, which maintain separate lock files and have different installation strategies.

**User** _at 10:58 am, Jun 16, 2024_

After installing, I am still getting this type of error:

```tsx

**Codeium** _at 10:59 am, Jun 16, 2024_

The error "Command 'react-docgen' not found" suggests that Yarn is unable to locate the `react-docgen` command in the local `node_modules/.bin/` directory where Yarn installs executable commands from dependencies.

Here are a few things to check and try:

1. **Verify Local Installation**:
    Make sure `react-docgen` is installed in your project's `node_modules` directory. You should find it under `node_modules/.bin/`.

2. **Check `node_modules/.bin/`**:
    If you have `react-docgen` installed, check the `node_modules/.bin/` directory to see if the `react-docgen` executable is present there.

3. **Use `yarn bin` to Check Executable Path**:
    You can use `yarn bin` to find the exact path to the Yarn bin directory where executables are located.

    Run:
    ```pwsh
    yarn bin
    ```
    
    This will give you the path to the bin directory. Check if `react-docgen` is there.

4. **Run the Script Using `yarn run`**:
    If you have defined a script in your `package.json` to run `react-docgen`, make sure to use `yarn run` to execute it:

    ```json
    "scripts": {
      "generate-docs": "react-docgen src/components/* --out-dir ./component-docs"
    }
    ```

    Then run it with:

    ```pwsh
    yarn run generate-docs
    ```

5. **Check Yarn Version**:
    In Yarn 1.x, you may need to run `yarn` before running `yarn run` to ensure all executables are properly linked.

6. **Check for `node_modules` Caching**:
    If you switched between `npm` and Yarn, there might be caching issues. Try deleting the `node_modules` directory and the Yarn lock file (`yarn.lock`), and then reinstall your dependencies with:

    ```pwsh
    yarn install
    ```

7. **Check `package.json` for Dependencies**:
    Make sure `react-docgen` is listed in the `devDependencies` of your `package.json` file after you've installed it.

8. **File System Permissions**:
    Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to execute files in the `node_modules/.bin/` directory.

If you've tried all of the above and the issue persists, it could be a more complex problem with your Yarn setup or the way the `react-docgen` package is installed. It might be worth checking the Yarn logs or running Yarn with the `--verbose` flag for more detailed output that could help diagnose the issue.

---

**User** _at 11:09 am, Jun 16, 2024_

I do not see `react-docgen` in `node_modules/.bin/`

```pwsh
üïê[11:06:44]‚ùØ ls .\node_modules\.bin\*docgen*.*
handex-react on ÓÇ† master [$!] via Óúò v20.12.1 on ‚òÅÔ∏è¬†(us-west-1)¬†
```

---

**Codeium** _at 11:09 am, Jun 16, 2024_

If `react-docgen` is not in the `node_modules/.bin/` directory, it seems like the installation did not succeed or the package does not provide a binary executable under that name. Here's what you can do:

1. **Double-check Installation**:
    Make sure you've installed `react-docgen` correctly with Yarn by running:

    ```pwsh
    yarn add --dev react-docgen
    ```

    After installation, check if `react-docgen` appears in the `devDependencies` section of your `package.json`.

2. **Clear Yarn Cache**:
    There may be a problem with your Yarn cache. Clear it with:

    ```pwsh
    yarn cache clean
    ```

    And then try installing `react-docgen` again.

3. **Manual Verification**:
    Manually verify if `react-docgen` is inside the `node_modules/react-docgen` directory after you've attempted to install it.

4. **Check for Errors**:
    Pay attention to any error messages that appear during installation, as they may indicate what went wrong. If an error mentions missing write permissions, you may need to adjust permissions for your project directory.

5. **Use a Different Approach**:
    Since you're having trouble with the command-line utility, consider using the `react-docgen` API directly in a Node.js script as an alternative.

    Here's a simple example of how you could use the `react-docgen` API in a Node script:

    ```js
    const fs = require('fs');
    const path = require('path');
    const reactDocgen = require('react-docgen');

    const componentsDir = path.join(__dirname, 'src/components');
    const outputDir = path.join(__dirname, 'component-docs');

    fs.readdir(componentsDir, (err, files) => {
      files.forEach(file => {
        const filePath = path.join(componentsDir, file);
        const source = fs.readFileSync(filePath);
        const componentInfo = reactDocgen.parse(source);

        // Now you can use `componentInfo` or write it to a file
        const outputFilePath = path.join(outputDir, `${file}.json`);
        fs.writeFileSync(outputFilePath, JSON.stringify(componentInfo, null, 2));
      });
    });
    ```

    Save this to a file, e.g., `generate-docs.js`, and run it with Node:

    ```pwsh
    node generate-docs.js
    ```

    Be sure to adjust the script to match your project structure and files.

6. **Seek Further Help**:
    If none of the above solutions work, consider seeking help from the `react-docgen` repository by filing an issue, or check the Yarn community for similar issues.

So I am going to try your "5. Different Approach"

---

**Codeium** _at 12:12 pm, Jun 16, 2024_

Based on the errors you're encountering, it seems that there are permission issues on your system, as indicated by the `EPERM: operation not permitted` error. This might be interfering with Yarn's ability to link and create executables in `node_modules/.bin/`. 

Before you try the different approach with the Node.js script, you could attempt to fix the permission issue:

1. **Run as Administrator**: Try running your command prompt or PowerShell as an administrator and then run the Yarn add command again.

2. **Check for Locked Files**: The `EPERM` error suggests that `esbuild.exe` might be in use or locked by another process, preventing Yarn from modifying it. Make sure no processes are using that file, and you can try deleting it manually and then running `yarn install` again.

3. **Disable Antivirus Temporarily**: Sometimes antivirus software can interfere with file operations. If you have antivirus software running, try disabling it temporarily and then run the installation again.

If you still wish to proceed with the different approach using the Node.js script, remember to adjust the script to match your exact project structure and file paths. Here's the script provided earlier, slightly adjusted to be more robust:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
const reactDocgen = require('react-docgen');
const glob = require('glob');

const componentsDir = path.join(__dirname, 'src/components');
const outputDir = path.join(__dirname, 'component-docs');

// Use glob to find all component files
glob(path.join(componentsDir, '**/*.tsx'), (err, files) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('Error finding component files:', err);
    return;
  }

  // Ensure output directory exists
  if (!fs.existsSync(outputDir)) {
    fs.mkdirSync(outputDir, { recursive: true });
  }

  files.forEach((file) => {
    const source = fs.readFileSync(file, 'utf8');
    try {
      const componentInfo = reactDocgen.parse(source);
      const outputFilePath = path.join(outputDir, `${path.basename(file, '.tsx')}.json`);
      fs.writeFileSync(outputFilePath, JSON.stringify(componentInfo, null, 2));
      console.log(`Generated docs for ${file}`);
    } catch (parseError) {
      console.error(`Error parsing ${file}:`, parseError);
    }
  });
});
```

Save this script to a file in the root of your project, e.g., `generate-docs.js`. Make sure to install `glob` which helps with file path patterns:

```pwsh
yarn add glob --dev
```

Then run the script with Node.js:

```pwsh
node generate-docs.js
```

This script will create a JSON file with the component documentation for each `.tsx` file in your `src/components` directory. Adjust the `componentsDir` and `outputDir` variables as needed to match your project's directory structure.

The `EPERM: operation not permitted` error while running Yarn as an administrator suggests that the file it's trying to modify is locked or inaccessible due to system permissions, even when running with elevated privileges. Here are some additional steps you can try:

1. **Check if the File is in Use**:
   Ensure that the file `rollup.win32-x64-msvc.node` is not being used by another process. You can check this using the Resource Monitor or any other process explorer tool.

2. **Restart Your Machine**:
   Sometimes, simply restarting your computer can resolve issues with locked files.

3. **Manually Remove the File**:
   Navigate to the file path `C:\Users\xgenx\source\repos\handex-react\node_modules\@rollup\rollup-win32-x64-msvc\` and try to manually delete the `rollup.win32-x64-msvc.node` file. After removing it, try running `yarn install` again.

4. **Manually Remove `node_modules` and Reinstall**:
   If the above doesn't work, you can try manually deleting the entire `node_modules` directory and then running `yarn install` to reinstall all packages:

   ```pwsh
   Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules
   yarn install
   ```

5. **Exclude the Directory from Antivirus Scanning**:
   Some antivirus software may lock files during scanning, which can interfere with Yarn's operations. Try adding an exclusion for your project directory in your antivirus settings and then run the install command again.

6. **Check for File System Errors**:
   There may be file system errors on your disk. You can use the `chkdsk` utility to check for and repair file system errors. Open the Command Prompt as an administrator and run:

   ```pwsh
   chkdsk /f /r
   ```

   Then restart your computer and try the installation again.

7. **Run Yarn with Verbose Logging**:
   Running Yarn with verbose logging might provide additional insights into what's going wrong:

   ```pwsh
   yarn install --verbose
   ```

If you continue to experience issues, it may be worth considering creating a new clone of the repository in a different directory or on a different machine to see if the problem persists.

Given the persistent issues with package installation, using the Node.js script approach seems to be a viable alternative to generate your component documentation without relying on the `react-docgen` executable. If you decide to go this route, follow the instructions provided in the previous message to run the `generate-docs.js` script.

It looks like stopping the website allowed Yarn to complete the installation without any file locking issues. The output indicates that the installation has now been successful. The "Done in 20.11s." message at the end suggests that all packages, including `react-docgen`, should now be installed correctly.

You can now try to generate your component documentation with `react-docgen`. Since it was not appearing in the `node_modules/.bin/` directory previously, please verify its presence now:

```pwsh
ls .\node_modules\.bin\*docgen*.*
```

If `react-docgen` is present, you can attempt to run it again using Yarn:

```pwsh
yarn react-docgen src/components/* --out-dir ./component-docs
```

Or, if you have added a script to your `package.json` to run `react-docgen`, you can execute that script with:

```pwsh
yarn run generate-docs
```

If you still encounter issues with the `react-docgen` command, you have the option to use the script approach that I outlined earlier, which directly uses the `react-docgen` API in a Node.js script to generate documentation.

**Codeium** _at 12:29 pm, Jun 16, 2024_

Given that `react-docgen` still isn't appearing in `node_modules/.bin/` and the Yarn command isn't recognizing it, it may be worth trying a clean installation. Before you do that, let's make sure we've covered all bases:

1. **Verify `react-docgen` is in `package.json`**:
   Check your `package.json` file to ensure that `react-docgen` is listed under `devDependencies` after running `yarn add --dev react-docgen`.

2. **Clear Yarn Cache**:
   Clearing the Yarn cache can sometimes resolve strange installation issues.
   ```pwsh
   yarn cache clean
   ```

3. **Remove `node_modules` and `yarn.lock`**:
   Deleting the `node_modules` directory and `yarn.lock` file can help ensure a fresh installation.
   ```pwsh
   Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules
   Remove-Item yarn.lock
   ```

4. **Reinstall Packages**:
   After clearing the cache and removing the directories, try installing your packages again.
   ```pwsh
   yarn install
   ```

5. **Check for `react-docgen` Binaries**:
   After installation, check again for the presence of `react-docgen` in `node_modules/.bin/`.

If you've gone through these steps and `react-docgen` is still not found, you may want to consider the following alternatives:

- **Use a Different Machine or Environment**: If possible, try installing the project on a different machine or environment to see if the issue is specific to your current setup.

- **Use the Node.js Script Approach**: As mentioned earlier, you can use the `react-docgen` API directly in a Node.js script to generate your documentation. This bypasses the need for the command-line tool.

- **Contact Yarn or `react-docgen` Support**: There might be an issue with Yarn's handling of binaries or a problem with the `react-docgen` package itself. Consider reaching out to the maintainers for support.

- **Consider Using npm**: If Yarn continues to be problematic, you could try switching to npm just for the sake of running `react-docgen`. However, this is not recommended if you're using Yarn for the rest of your project, as it could lead to inconsistencies.

If you decide to proceed with a clean installation, follow the steps above. If the issue persists, you may want to try the Node.js script as a reliable workaround.

**User** _at 12:30 pm, Jun 16, 2024_

will `yarn install` install it as a local dev-dependency? Does `yarn` allow global installs?

---

**Codeium** _at 12:31 pm, Jun 16, 2024_

`yarn install` will install all the dependencies listed in your `package.json` file, including `devDependencies`. It installs the packages locally within your project's `node_modules` directory, not globally.

Yarn does allow global installs, but they are generally discouraged in favor of local installs, especially for project-specific tools. To install a package globally using Yarn, you would use the `yarn global add` command. Here's how you would do it:

```pwsh
yarn global add package-name
```

However, for tools like `react-docgen` that are used within the scope of a project, it is better to install them locally as `devDependencies`. This ensures that anyone else working on the project has access to the same tools and versions, which helps maintain a consistent development environment.

To install `react-docgen` as a local dev-dependency, you should use:

```pwsh
yarn add --dev react-docgen
```

This command adds `react-docgen` to your `devDependencies` in your `package.json` and installs it in your local `node_modules` directory. If `react-docgen` is still not found after running this command, then there may be an issue with the package, Yarn's installation process, or your system's configuration. If that's the case, using the Node.js script approach to directly use the `react-docgen` API, as previously discussed, might be the best alternative.

**Codeium** _at 12:32 pm, Jun 16, 2024_

Based on your `package.json`, `react-docgen` is indeed listed under `devDependencies`, which means running `yarn install` should install it locally within your project's `node_modules` directory.

After running `yarn install`, `react-docgen` should be installed, and you should be able to find the executable in the `node_modules/.bin/` directory.

If after installation you cannot find `react-docgen` in `node_modules/.bin/` or if you're still having issues running the `react-docgen` command, you might want to try the Node.js script approach that directly utilizes the `react-docgen` API, as previously discussed.

If you run into any more issues or need further assistance, feel free to ask.

The installation of your packages seems to have completed successfully with the message "Done in 133.45s." However, the fact that you're still getting "error Command 'react-docgen' not found" indicates that Yarn is not recognizing the `react-docgen` command.

Since we've confirmed that `react-docgen` is in your `package.json` and you've run `yarn install`, let's try a couple more things:

1. **Manually Verify the `react-docgen` Installation**:
   Manually check if the `react-docgen` package has been installed by looking in the `node_modules/react-docgen` directory within your project. There should be a package folder there if it was installed correctly.

2. **Check the `.bin` Directory Again**:
   Even though you've checked before, let's verify once more if the `react-docgen` binary is present in `node_modules/.bin/` after the fresh install.

   ```pwsh
   ls .\node_modules\.bin\*docgen*.*
   ```

3. **Check the Yarn Lock File**:
   A new `yarn.lock` file should have been generated. You can open this file and search for `react-docgen` to confirm it is included there.

If `react-docgen` is installed and still not recognized, it might be an environment issue or a problem with the Yarn setup on your system. As a next step, I recommend using the Node.js script approach to call `react-docgen` directly from the installed package without relying on the Yarn command.

Here's a basic Node.js script which you can save as `generate-docs.js` and run with Node:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
const reactDocgen = require('react-docgen');
const glob = require('glob');

const componentsDir = path.join(__dirname, 'src/components');
const outputDir = path.join(__dirname, 'component-docs');

// Create the output directory if it doesn't exist
if (!fs.existsSync(outputDir)) {
  fs.mkdirSync(outputDir, { recursive: true });
}

// Use glob to handle file matching
glob(path.join(componentsDir, '**', '*.tsx'), (error, files) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error('Error with glob pattern:', error);
    return;
  }

  files.forEach(file => {
    const source = fs.readFileSync(file, 'utf8');
    try {
      const doc = reactDocgen.parse(source);
      const outputPath = path.join(outputDir, path.basename(file, path.extname(file)) + '.json');
      fs.writeFileSync(outputPath, JSON.stringify(doc, null, 2));
      console.log(`Documentation generated for ${file}`);
    } catch (e) {
      console.error(`Error generating documentation for ${file}:`, e);
    }
  });
});
```

Before running the script, make sure to install `glob`:

```pwsh
yarn add --dev glob
```

Then run the script using Node:

```pwsh
node generate-docs.js
```

This script will read your `.tsx` files in the `src/components` directory and generate a corresponding `.json` documentation file in the `component-docs` directory for each component. Please adjust the paths in the script if your components are located in a different directory.

The error message indicates that your Node.js environment is treating `generate-docs.js` as an ES module because your `package.json` contains `"type": "module"`. In ES modules, the `require` syntax is not supported, and you need to use `import` instead.

You have two options to fix this:

### Option 1: Rename the File Extension to `.cjs`

Rename your `generate-docs.js` file to `generate-docs.cjs`. This will signal to Node.js that the file should be treated as a CommonJS module, which supports the `require` syntax.

### Option 2: Update the Script to Use ES Modules Syntax

Convert the CommonJS `require` statements in `generate-docs.js` to ES Modules `import` statements. Here's an updated version of your script using ES Modules syntax:

```javascript
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';
import reactDocgen from 'react-docgen';
import glob from 'glob';

const componentsDir = path.join(process.cwd(), 'src/components');
const outputDir = path.join(process.cwd(), 'component-docs');

// Create the output directory if it doesn't exist
if (!fs.existsSync(outputDir)) {
  fs.mkdirSync(outputDir, { recursive: true });
}

// Use glob to handle file matching
glob(path.join(componentsDir, '**', '*.tsx'), (error, files) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error('Error with glob pattern:', error);
    return;
  }

  files.forEach(file => {
    const source = fs.readFileSync(file, 'utf8');
    try {
      const doc = reactDocgen.parse(source);
      const outputPath = path.join(outputDir, path.basename(file, path.extname(file)) + '.json');
      fs.writeFileSync(outputPath, JSON.stringify(doc, null, 2));
      console.log(`Documentation generated for ${file}`);
    } catch (e) {
      console.error(`Error generating documentation for ${file}:`, e);
    }
  });
});
```

After updating the script, run it with Node as before:

```pwsh
node generate-docs.js
```

Choose one of these options based on your preference for module syntax and try running the script again.

The error indicates that `react-docgen` is an ES module, and since you're working in a CommonJS context (by using `.cjs`), you cannot use `require()` to import it. To resolve this, you will need to use dynamic `import()` instead.

Here's how you can modify your `generate-docs.cjs` script to use dynamic imports:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
const glob = require('glob');

const componentsDir = path.join(__dirname, 'src/components');
const outputDir = path.join(__dirname, 'component-docs');

// Create the output directory if it doesn't exist
if (!fs.existsSync(outputDir)) {
  fs.mkdirSync(outputDir, { recursive: true });
}

// Use glob to handle file matching
glob(path.join(componentsDir, '**', '*.tsx'), async (error, files) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error('Error with glob pattern:', error);
    return;
  }

  // Dynamically import the reactDocgen module
  const reactDocgen = await import('react-docgen');

  files.forEach(file => {
    const source = fs.readFileSync(file, 'utf8');
    try {
      const doc = reactDocgen.parse(source);
      const outputPath = path.join(outputDir, path.basename(file, path.extname(file)) + '.json');
      fs.writeFileSync(outputPath, JSON.stringify(doc, null, 2));
      console.log(`Documentation generated for ${file}`);
    } catch (e) {
      console.error(`Error generating documentation for ${file}:`, e);
    }
  });
});
```

In this updated script, `reactDocgen` is imported dynamically inside the `glob` callback. Note that the `glob` callback is now an `async` function to allow the use of `await` for dynamic import.

After updating the script, run it with Node:

```pwsh
node generate-docs.cjs
```

This should correctly import the `react-docgen` module and execute your documentation generation script.

The error you're seeing suggests that the `glob` module is not being imported correctly. Since `glob` is a CommonJS module, it should be correctly required with `require()`. However, the error message "glob is not a function" indicates that the import isn't working as expected.

Let's make sure the `glob` package is installed. Run the following command to install it:

```pwsh
yarn add --dev glob
```

After installing, update your `generate-docs.cjs` script to ensure `glob` is imported correctly:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
const glob = require('glob');

const componentsDir = path.join(__dirname, 'src/components');
const outputDir = path.join(__dirname, 'component-docs');

// Create the output directory if it doesn't exist
if (!fs.existsSync(outputDir)) {
  fs.mkdirSync(outputDir, { recursive: true });
}

// Use glob to handle file matching
glob(path.join(componentsDir, '**', '*.tsx'), async (error, files) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error('Error with glob pattern:', error);
    return;
  }

  const reactDocgen = await import('react-docgen');

  files.forEach(file => {
    const source = fs.readFileSync(file, 'utf8');
    try {
      const doc = reactDocgen.parse(source);
      const outputPath = path.join(outputDir, path.basename(file, path.extname(file)) + '.json');
      fs.writeFileSync(outputPath, JSON.stringify(doc, null, 2));
      console.log(`Documentation generated for ${file}`);
    } catch (e) {
      console.error(`Error generating documentation for ${file}:`, e);
    }
  });
});
```

Ensure that you save the script after making changes and then run the following command:

```pwsh
node generate-docs.cjs
```

This should execute the script without the previous error, provided `glob` is installed correctly. If the issue persists, please make sure that the `glob` package exists in your `node_modules` directory and is listed in your `package.json` under `devDependencies`.

The error message suggests that the script is still not recognizing `glob` as a function. This might happen if the `glob` module is not being imported properly or if there is a version mismatch that causes the module not to export a function. 

Let's try to diagnose the issue further:

1. **Ensure `glob` is correctly installed**: Check your `node_modules` directory to confirm that `glob` is indeed there and correctly installed.

2. **Check `package.json`**: Make sure that `glob` is listed in your `package.json` under `devDependencies`.

If `glob` is installed and present in your `package.json`, let's try to adjust the import to ensure that it is used as a function. The `glob` module exports a function by default, so you should be able to require it as shown previously.

Here is the script with explicit function call to `glob`:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
const glob = require('glob');

const componentsDir = path.join(__dirname, 'src/components');
const outputDir = path.join(__dirname, 'component-docs');

// Create the output directory if it doesn't exist
if (!fs.existsSync(outputDir)) {
  fs.mkdirSync(outputDir, { recursive: true });
}

// Use glob to handle file matching
glob(path.join(componentsDir, '**/*.tsx'), async (error, files) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error('Error with glob pattern:', error);
    return;
  }

  // Dynamically import the reactDocgen module
  const reactDocgen = await import('react-docgen');

  for (const file of files) {
    const source = fs.readFileSync(file, 'utf8');
    try {
      const doc = reactDocgen.parse(source);
      const outputPath = path.join(outputDir, path.basename(file, path.extname(file)) + '.json');
      fs.writeFileSync(outputPath, JSON.stringify(doc, null, 2));
      console.log(`Documentation generated for ${file}`);
    } catch (e) {
      console.error(`Error generating documentation for ${file}:`, e);
    }
  }
});
```

Please note the minor change in the `glob` call and make sure that you have changed the file extension to `.cjs` if you're using CommonJS modules.

Save the changes and run the script again with:

```pwsh
node generate-docs.cjs
```

If the issue persists, there might be a deeper problem with the Node.js setup or the specific versions of the packages. We may need to debug further by examining the exact contents of the `glob` module within your `node_modules` directory, or by trying the script in a different environment.

It seems there is an issue with the `glob` module, despite it being correctly installed and imported. The error message persists, which is unusual. Let's try another approach to ensure that the `glob` module is loaded properly.

We'll use the `glob` function directly from the imported `glob` module object to see if that resolves the problem. Here's how you can modify your `generate-docs.cjs` script:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
const globModule = require('glob');

const componentsDir = path.join(__dirname, 'src/components');
const outputDir = path.join(__dirname, 'component-docs');

// Create the output directory if it doesn't exist
if (!fs.existsSync(outputDir)) {
  fs.mkdirSync(outputDir, { recursive: true });
}

// Use glob to handle file matching
globModule(path.join(componentsDir, '**/*.tsx'), async (error, files) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error('Error with glob pattern:', error);
    return;
  }

  // Dynamically import the reactDocgen module
  const reactDocgen = await import('react-docgen');

  for (const file of files) {
    const source = fs.readFileSync(file, 'utf8');
    try {
      const doc = reactDocgen.parse(source);
      const outputPath = path.join(outputDir, path.basename(file, path.extname(file)) + '.json');
      fs.writeFileSync(outputPath, JSON.stringify(doc, null, 2));
      console.log(`Documentation generated for ${file}`);
    } catch (e) {
      console.error(`Error generating documentation for ${file}:`, e);
    }
  }
});
```

In the updated script, I've changed the `glob` import to `globModule` to avoid any potential naming conflicts. Please make sure to save this updated script and run it again:

```pwsh
node generate-docs.cjs
```

If this still doesn't resolve the issue, there may be a problem with the Node.js environment or the `glob` module itself. In such a case, you might want to try running the script in a different environment or consider reinstalling Node.js.
