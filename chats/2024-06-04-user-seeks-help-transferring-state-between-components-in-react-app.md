summary: This chat involved a user seeking assistance with lifting the `currentFontSize` state from the `XtermAdapter` class to the `HandexTerm` class. The conversation covered steps to achieve this, including creating a state in `HandexTerm` for font size, passing a callback to update font size, and updating the font size in both components.

Later, the user realized they needed to move the entire font resizing logic to `HandexTerm` and encountered an error related to preventing default behavior in a passive event listener. The solution involved manually adding event listeners with `{ passive: false }` option to allow calling `event.preventDefault()`.

The chat also discussed passing an event back to `HandexTerm` from `NextCharsDisplay` when a phrase is successfully completed. This involved defining a method in `HandexTerm` to handle phrase success, passing it as a prop to `NextCharsDisplay`, and triggering the callback from `NextCharsDisplay` upon phrase completion.

Overall, the chat revolved around state management, event handling, and callback communication between components in a React application.

I need to life the `currentFontSize` from the `XtermAdapter` to the `HandexTerm` that instantiates it.

How can I do that?

To lift the `currentFontSize` state from the `XtermAdapter` class to the `HandexTerm` class, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a new state in `HandexTerm` to hold the font size.
2. Pass a callback from `HandexTerm` to `XtermAdapter` that updates this state.
3. Call this callback in `XtermAdapter` whenever the font size changes.

In `HandexTerm`, you would add a state and a method to update it:

```tsx
class HandexTerm extends React.Component {
  // ... existing code ...

  state = {
    // ... existing state ...
    terminalFontSize: 17, // The default size or loaded from somewhere
  };

  // Method to update font size in HandexTerm state
  updateTerminalFontSize = (newSize: number) => {
    this.setState({ terminalFontSize: newSize });
  };

  // ... rest of your component ...
}
```

Then, pass `updateTerminalFontSize` to `XtermAdapter`:

```tsx
<XtermAdapter
  // ... other props ...
  updateFontSize={this.updateTerminalFontSize}
/>
```

In `XtermAdapter`, you would call `updateFontSize` passed via props:

```tsx
class XtermAdapter extends React.Component {
  // ... existing code ...

  public handleTouchMove: TouchEventHandler<HTMLDivElement> = (event: React.TouchEvent<HTMLDivElement>) => {
    if (event.touches.length === 2) {
      // ... existing code ...
      if (this.lastTouchDistance) {
        // ... existing code ...
        this.currentFontSize *= scaleFactor;
        // Update font size in XtermAdapter state (if you have local state for it)
        // and lift the state up to HandexTerm
        this.props.updateFontSize(this.currentFontSize);

        // ... existing code ...
      }
    }
  };
  
  // ... rest of your component ...
}
```

Make sure to adjust the `XtermAdapter`'s props type to include the new `updateFontSize` callback:

```tsx
interface IXtermAdapterProps {
  // ... existing prop types ...
  updateFontSize: (newFontSize: number) => void;
}
```

This way, whenever the font size changes in `XtermAdapter`, it will inform `HandexTerm` of the change, and `HandexTerm` will update its own state accordingly.

Actually, I think I might have stated that wrong.

I think I need to move the whole font-resizing code up and into the `HandTerm`. I moved the `Output` up there and I had been resizing on pinching that too.

To move the entire font resizing logic from `XtermAdapter` to `HandexTerm`, you need to:

1. Remove the font resizing logic from `XtermAdapter`.
2. Implement the font resizing logic in `HandexTerm`.
3. Use refs or methods to update the font size of the terminal in `XtermAdapter` from `HandexTerm`.

Here's how you could implement the changes:

**Step 1:** Remove the font resizing logic from `XtermAdapter`, including methods like `loadFontSize`, `increaseFontSize`, and any event handlers related to touch events that change the font size.

**Step 2:** In `HandexTerm`, you can add touch event handlers that implement the resizing logic. Since you want to resize the font on pinch gestures, you will handle touch events similar to `handleTouchMove` in `XtermAdapter`.

```tsx
class HandexTerm extends React.Component {
  // ... existing code ...

  handleTouchStart: TouchEventHandler<HTMLDivElement> = (event: React.TouchEvent<HTMLDivElement>) => {
    // Your touch start logic
  };

  handleTouchMove: TouchEventHandler<HTMLDivElement> = (event: React.TouchEvent<HTMLDivElement>) => {
    if (event.touches.length === 2) {
      // Your touch move logic for resizing the font
      const currentDistance = this.getDistanceBetweenTouches(event.touches);
      // Calculate the font size change based on the distance moved
      // Update the state with the new font size
      this.setState({ terminalFontSize: newFontSize });
    }
  };

  handleTouchEnd: TouchEventHandler<HTMLDivElement> = (event: React.TouchEvent<HTMLDivElement>) => {
    // Your touch end logic
  };

  getDistanceBetweenTouches(touches: React.TouchList): number {
    // Implement the logic to calculate the distance between two touches
  }

  // ... rest of your component ...
}
```

**Step 3:** Whenever the `terminalFontSize` state changes in `HandexTerm`, use a method in `XtermAdapter` to update the font size of the terminal. You could call this method in the `componentDidUpdate` lifecycle method of the `HandexTerm` class after checking that the font size has changed.

```tsx
componentDidUpdate(prevProps: Readonly<IHandexTermProps>, prevState: IHandexTermState) {
  // Check if terminalFontSize has changed
  if (prevState.terminalFontSize !== this.state.terminalFontSize) {
    this.adapterRef.current?.updateFontSize(this.state.terminalFontSize);
  }
}
```

And in `XtermAdapter`, you would have:

```tsx
class XtermAdapter extends React.Component {
  // ... existing code ...

  public updateFontSize(fontSize: number): void {
    // Update the terminal's font size
    this.terminal.options.fontSize = fontSize;
    this.terminal.refresh(0, this.terminal.rows - 1);
    // Any other logic needed to apply the new font size
  }

  // ... rest of your component ...
}
```

Remember to remove or comment out any code related to font resizing from `XtermAdapter` that is no longer necessary and ensure that the `XtermAdapterProps` interface reflects any changes you've made to the props.

I sort of have everything moved upt to `HandexTerm`, but I get this error:

```

HandexTerm.tsx:446  
Unable to preventDefault inside passive event listener invocation.

```tsx
 public handleTouchMove: TouchEventHandler<HTMLDivElement> = (event: React.TouchEvent<HTMLDivElement>) => {
  if (event.touches.length === 2) {
   event.preventDefault();
   const currentDistance = this.getDistanceBetweenTouches(event.touches);
   if (this.lastTouchDistance) {
    const scaleFactor = currentDistance / this.lastTouchDistance;
    this.currentFontSize *= scaleFactor;
    // TODO: Figure out how to resize fonts now with REact.
    document.documentElement.style.setProperty('--terminal-font-size', `${this.currentFontSize}pt`);
    this.lastTouchDistance = currentDistance;

I am trying to prevent the browser zooming while I'm trying to resize the font.

The error message you're seeing is due to the browser's intervention when trying to call `event.preventDefault()` inside a passive event listener. In many browsers, the touch event listeners are passive by default to improve scrolling performance. When an event listener is passive, you cannot prevent the default action using `event.preventDefault()`.

To fix this, you need to explicitly indicate that the event listener is not passive when you add it, which allows you to call `event.preventDefault()`. However, since you are using React's `onTouchMove` prop to assign the event listener, you don't have direct control over how the event listener is added to the element.

To work around this, you can add the event listener manually in the `componentDidMount` lifecycle method and remove it in the `componentWillUnmount` method, like so:

```tsx
class HandexTerm extends React.Component {
  // ... existing code ...

  componentDidMount() {
    this.addTouchListeners();
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    this.removeTouchListeners();
  }

  addTouchListeners() {
    // Assuming 'terminalElementRef' points to the div you want to attach the event
    const div = this.terminalElementRef.current;
    if (div) {
      div.addEventListener('touchmove', this.handleTouchMove, { passive: false });
    }
  }

  removeTouchListeners() {
    const div = this.terminalElementRef.current;
    if (div) {
      div.removeEventListener('touchmove', this.handleTouchMove);
    }
  }

  handleTouchMove = (event: TouchEvent) => {
    if (event.touches.length === 2) {
      event.preventDefault();
      const currentDistance = this.getDistanceBetweenTouches(event.touches);
      // ... your existing logic ...
    }
  };

  // ... rest of your component ...
}
```

With this approach, you're manually adding the event listener with the `{ passive: false }` option, which indicates that you want the ability to call `event.preventDefault()`. Remember to adjust the `handleTouchMove` method to match the correct event type (`TouchEvent` instead of `React.TouchEvent`), as we're now directly working with the DOM API.

Note: Be aware that setting `{ passive: false }` can have performance implications, particularly on mobile devices, as it may delay touch scrolling. Use this approach judiciously.

The `NextCharsDisplay` has a `onPhraseSuccess()` property passed in to it.

I think in React, that is a way to pass an event back up to the `HandexTerm`, but I don't think I have it implemented properly.

I need to report the completion of the phrase to the `HandexTerm` so that it can handle a behaviour in the `TerminalGame`

---

**Codeium** _at 6:35 pm, Jun 4, 2024_

From the provided context, `NextCharsDisplay` indeed has a `onPhraseSuccess` prop which is intended to be a callback function. This callback is designed to notify the parent component (`HandexTerm`) when a phrase is successfully completed.

To ensure that `onPhraseSuccess` is working properly, you should:

1. Define the `onPhraseSuccess` method in `HandexTerm`.
2. Pass this method as a prop to `NextCharsDisplay`.

Here's an example of how you might implement this in `HandexTerm`:

```tsx
class HandexTerm extends React.Component {
  // ... existing code ...

  handlePhraseSuccess = (phrase: string, wpm: number) => {
    // Perform the actions you want on phrase success, e.g., update the state
    // or call methods on TerminalGame
    console.log('Phrase completed:', phrase, 'with WPM:', wpm);
    // You mentioned setting an action in TerminalGame, e.g.,
    this.terminalGameRef.current?.setZombie4Action('Die');
    // ... any other logic for handling phrase success ...
  };

  // ... rest of your component ...

  render() {
    return (
      // ... other components ...
      <NextCharsDisplay
        // ... other props ...
        onPhraseSuccess={this.handlePhraseSuccess}
      />
      // ... other components ...
    );
  }
}
```

And in `NextCharsDisplay`, when the phrase is completed successfully, you would call the `onPhraseSuccess` prop:

```tsx
class NextCharsDisplay extends React.Component {
  // ... existing code ...

  // This is an example method that gets called when a phrase is completed.
  someMethodThatCompletesPhrase() {
    // Let's say the phrase completion logic determines the phrase and WPM
    const phrase = 'completed phrase';
    const wpm = 120;

    // Now call the onPhraseSuccess callback, which was passed from HandexTerm
    this.props.onPhraseSuccess(phrase, wpm);
  }

  // ... rest of your component ...
}
```

Make sure that `onPhraseSuccess` is correctly typed in the props interface for `NextCharsDisplay`:

```tsx
interface NextCharsDisplayProps {
  // ... other props ...
  onPhraseSuccess: (phrase: string, wpm: number) => void;
}
```

By following this pattern, the `NextCharsDisplay` component communicates the success event back to the `HandexTerm`, which can then handle any additional logic required, such as updating the state or invoking behaviors in other components like `TerminalGame`.
