Explain problem: `Argument of type 'Position' is not assignable to parameter of type 'BaseCharacterProps'.
  Property 'position' is missing in type 'Position' but required in type 'BaseCharacterProps'.`

The issue "Argument of type 'Position' is not assignable to parameter of type 'BaseCharacterProps'. Property 'position' is missing in type 'Position' but required in type 'BaseCharacterProps'" is occurring because the `Zombie4` class is extending `BaseCharacter` and the constructor of `Zombie4` is missing the required property `position` from the `BaseCharacterProps`.

To resolve this, you need to make sure that the `Zombie4` class constructor initializes the `position` property with the provided `position` parameter and passes it to the `super` call. 

Here's how you can update the constructor of the `Zombie4` class:

```tsx
export class Zombie4 extends BaseCharacter {
  constructor(context: CanvasRenderingContext2D, actionType: ActionType, position: Position) {
    super(context, Zombie4Actions, actionType, { position }); // Ensure position is passed as an object
    // Load sprites for different animations
  }
}
```

By passing the `position` as an object to the `super` call, you ensure that the `position` property is correctly initialized in the `BaseCharacterProps`.

Is there a way that I can declare the `ActionType` so that I can use it like an enum as well as how I am already using it?

I get an error here:

```tsx
 constructor(props: ITerminalGameProps) {
  super(props);
  this.state = {
   heroAction: ActionType.Run,
   heroPosition: { leftX: 75, topY: 20 },
   zombieAction: 'Walk',
   zombie4Position: { leftX: 30, topY: 0 },
   context: null as CanvasRenderingContext2D | null
  };
 }
```

I currently declare it like this:

```tsx
export type Action = {
 animation: SpriteAnimation;
 dx: number;
 dy: number;
 continueous: boolean;
};

const ActionType = {
 Run: 'Run',
 Idle: 'Idle',
 Walk: 'Walk',
 Jump: 'Jump',
 Attack: 'Attack',
 Die: 'Die',
 Hurt: 'Hurt',
} as const;

export type ActionType = typeof ActionType[keyof typeof ActionType];
```

To use `ActionType` like an enum, you can change the declaration from a `const` object to an actual `enum`. This way, you can use `ActionType.Run` as you have tried in your constructor, which is the enum syntax.

Here's how you can declare `ActionType` as an enum:

```tsx
export enum ActionType {
  Run = 'Run',
  Idle = 'Idle',
  Walk = 'Walk',
  Jump = 'Jump',
  Attack = 'Attack',
  Die = 'Die',
  Hurt = 'Hurt',
}
```

With this change, `ActionType` can be used as both a type and an enum value:

```tsx
// Now ActionType can be used like an enum
this.state = {
  heroAction: ActionType.Run, // This will work with enum declaration
  // ...
};
```

Keep in mind that if you use `ActionType` as an enum, it's not a plain object anymore, so you can't use it in the same way as an object (e.g., `ActionType['Run']`). Enums in TypeScript are their own special structure that compiles to an object in JavaScript, but they have enhanced autocompletion and refactoring support in editors like VSCode.
