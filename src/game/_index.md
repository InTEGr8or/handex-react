1. Define Character Base Class: Create a base class for all characters that includes common properties and methods required for animation.
1. Sprite Management: Use a sprite manager to handle loading and drawing frames for any character.
1. Zombie4 Class: Extend the base class to create a specific `Zombie4` class.
1. Animation Controller: Implement an animation controller to manage different states like idle, walking, etc.
1. Use TypeScript for Strong Typing: Leverage TypeScript's type system to ensure your code is well-typed.

## Additional Recommendations:

* State Machine: Implement a finite state machine for character states (idle, walking, etc.) to manage transitions and actions cleanly.
* Asset Loader: Use an asset loader to preload all images before the game starts.
* Performance: To improve performance, consider using sprite sheets and a sprite sheet parser to load and manage frames, as this can reduce the number of network requests and memory usage.
* Game Loop: Ensure you have a well-defined game loop that handles updates and rendering separately, possibly using requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations.
* Scalability: Organize your assets and classes by characters and scenarios to make it easier to add new content. Use consistent naming conventions and directory structures.
* Type Safety: Define interfaces or types for your animations and characters to enforce structure and reduce errors.
