1. **Refine Command Hooks:**
   - Ensure each command hook follows the same pattern as `useClearCommand`, accepting a context and returning a function that takes arguments and returns a string.
   - You might want to define an interface for the command hook to enforce consistency.

2. **Integrate CommandRegistry with Command Hooks:**
   - Modify `CommandRegistry` to store the hook associated with each command.
   - Update the `register` method to accept the hook function along with the `ICommand` object.

3. **Centralize Command Execution:**
   - Create a `CommandExecutor` component or function that uses both the `CommandRegistry` and `commandHooks` to execute commands.
   - This executor would take user input, look up the command in the registry, and then execute the appropriate hook.

4. **Build a Command Line Interface (CLI) Component:**
   - Develop a CLI component that handles user input, displays the terminal output, and utilizes the `CommandExecutor` to run commands.
   - Integrate `@xterm/xterm` for the terminal UI, handling keypresses and command execution.

5. **Consider Context for Global State:**
   - Use React Context to manage global state, such as the output to display in the terminal and any other necessary shared state.

6. **Implement Help Command:**
   - Add a `useHelpCommand` hook that leverages the `getHelp` method from `CommandRegistry` to display available commands and their descriptions.

7. **Consider Extensibility:**
   - Design your command structure to be easily extensible, allowing new commands to be added without major refactoring.

8. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement error handling within your command hooks and executor to gracefully deal with unrecognized commands or execution issues.

9. **Unit Testing:**
   - Write unit tests for your commands, registry, and executor to ensure that everything works as expected and to avoid regressions in the future.
