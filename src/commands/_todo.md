* [X] ~~*1. **Review the `CommandRegistry` and `ICommand` implementations.***~~ [2024-06-13]
   - [X] ~~*Ensure that the `CommandRegistry` class in `src/commands/commandRegistry.ts` follows the structure outlined in the design document.*~~ [2024-06-13]
   - [X] ~~*Verify that the `ICommand` interface in `src/commands/ICommand.ts` contains all necessary fields and methods for a command.*~~ [2024-06-13]

* [X] ~~*2. **Implement and review the `CommandContext` and `CommandProvider`.***~~ [2024-06-13]
   - [X] ~~*Confirm that `CommandContext` is created correctly and that `CommandProvider` is using the `executeCommand` function as described.*~~ [2024-06-13]
   - Check for any edge cases or error handling that might be necessary in the `executeCommand` function.

3. **Ensure commands are registered properly.**
   - [X] ~~*Look at `src/commands/registerCommands.ts` and make sure all commands are imported and registered as shown in the document.*~~ [2024-06-13]
   - Confirm that each command has its `execute` method implemented correctly.

4. **Use the context in components.**
   - Check components like `SomeComponent` in `src/components/SomeComponent.tsx` to verify they use the `useCommands` hook or `useContext(CommandContext)` as needed.

5. **Wrap the app with `CommandProvider`.**
   - In `src/App.tsx`, make sure that `CommandProvider` wraps the necessary components to provide command execution context.

6. **Remove stale code.**
   - Any old implementations for command execution that do not use the context should be considered for removal.
   - Look for any files or components that are no longer used or referenced and remove them if they are not part of the new design.

7. **Test the implementation.**
   - Manually test the command execution in the user interface to ensure commands are recognized and executed correctly.
   - Write unit tests for the command registry and execution logic if they do not already exist.

8. **Document the changes.**
   - Update any documentation to reflect the new design and usage instructions.
   - Comment your code where necessary to explain complex logic or design decisions.

9. **Consider command history implementation.**
   - If command history needs to be implemented or updated, consider how it will be stored and accessed.
   - Ensure the history feature integrates smoothly with the new command execution context.
